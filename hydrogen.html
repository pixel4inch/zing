                  <br/>
                  
                  <ul>

<li><strong>	Managing the Evolving Remote Workforce -</strong> Even as the pandemic recedes to the endemic stage and businesses are resuming operations with office space open as usual, the remote work model is continuing to co-exist with the in-office set-up. With a certain number employees in the workforce still working remotely, businesses face an uphill task. Considering each of the WFH employee works under a different living condition, the challenges are unique with no single solution. As in case of women employees, they need to balance work and home, and might lack a dedicated space for work from where they can focus on work alone. Businesses need to brainstorm means to bridge such gaps and overcome challenges of this distributed model.</li>
<li><strong>	Managing the Multigenerational Workforce -</strong> The current businesses work with a workforce that is the most diverse of all times. The characteristic feature of this workforce is the co-existence of employees that belong to five different generations. In companies working with all these five generations of people, a typical workforce mix would comprise the silent generation (people born between 1928 and 1945), the baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964), the generation X (born between 1965 and 1980), the generation Y or millennials (born between 1981 and 96) and the newest of all generation Z (from 1997 and continuing). Individually, people from each of these generations have unique expectations from their work lives, and bring with them different voices, skills and life experiences to their workplace that ultimately shapes a company’s work culture. Such a diverse workforce spanning five generations requires employers, business leaders and human resource managers to be well acquainted with the capabilities and characteristics of each of the generation, and have well framed strategies to make employees of all generations feel inclusive and celebrated for who they are.</li>
<li><strong>	Purging Unconscious Bias at Workplaces -</strong> Unconscious bias, the tendency to form opinions, process information and arrive at decisions on the basis of inherent or unconscious prejudices and biases towards certain groups of people or individuals, impacts the type of relationship an employer or business leader develops with each of its employee. Since this relationship influences the decisions that are made at workplaces, where a truly inclusive workforce comprises of people with varied ethnicity, backgrounds and experiences, it is important that businesses and their leaders have strategies in place that ensure such biases and prejudices are purged or controlled regularly.</li>
<li><strong>	Embracing Diverse Gender Identity & Expression -</strong> The recent years have seen awareness increase about the diverse gender identities and various gender expressions. As organizations the world have on their payroll people with such diverse gender identities, they need to adopt inclusive practices that may include providing gender-neutral restrooms, employee health benefits that support transitioning individuals, and creating a mindful atmosphere where use of inclusive language is encouraged to communicate with transgender or non-binary employees, among others.</li>
<li><strong>	Preparing for Systemic Change -</strong> Over the previous couple of years, there has been a rise in instances of systemic injustices reflective of the flaws that exist globally on institutional level. Appalling crimes against innocent people of color have brought to fore the unjust and racist nature of society that continues to exists even in the most developed nations. Businesses need to incorporate some critical systemic changes that would positively influence both the workplaces and societies at large. They can ensure racial discrimination is kept at bay by introducing policies that stress on safety of people of all races and create positive experiences at workplaces</li>
<li><strong>	Improved Transparency in Goal - </strong>A business with a diverse workforce need not imply a higher level of inclusion and equity. Even when organizations step up efforts to increase their diversity, the same might not translate into greater efforts at inclusivity. In order to become a truly diverse and inclusive organization, businesses would need to set transparent goals and targets and introduce relevant D&I initiatives. These measures would make those leading the organization more accountable, promote honest interactions between employees and their superiors, and foster an environment where employees feel encouraged to share their viewpoint, solutions and/or ideas.</li>
<li><strong>	The Time to Hire Diversity Professionals Has Come -</strong> With workplaces becoming more diverse, companies might require professional help. Diversity professionals are one of the newest categories of experts that organizations are hiring to address their D&I requirements. Diversity professionals come with the vision and mission to create a diverse and inclusive workplace, and handle multiple roles involving human resource and recruitment, as well as leadership responsibilities. They might need to multitask to organize and conduct D&I related educational sessions, introduce novel ideas for improved D&I atmosphere at a workplace, create an inclusive workplace culture, encourage all to use inclusive language, manage workplace discrimination or harassment related complaints, among others. The need for and role of diversity professionals is only expected to grow in the coming years.</li>
<li><strong>	Supporting Mental Health of Employees -</strong> Supporting mental health of employees has emerged as a priority for most organizations in order to ensure that their diverse talent pool continues to perform efficiently for optimal operational performance of a business. Businesses are aware of the toll the global pandemic and its repercussions have taken on the mental wellbeing of employees, and the difficulties their employees are facing in adjusting to the new normal. While some lost their jobs as businesses closed down, others had to adjust to the new work-from-home model, all while living in the fear of contracting coronavirus, which created a stressful environment for most people. By creating a supportive environment, businesses can ensure that metal health of their employees does not get compromised. They may achieve this through simpler means such as by encouraging managers, supervisors and peers to converse and empathize with each other.</li>
<li><strong>	Avoiding Gestures of Tokenism -</strong> Prioritizing diversity and inclusion means much more that simply hiring a woman in a boardroom or team full of men, or making way for one people of color in the workplace. Such a move could simply reflect an attitude of tokenism. Organizations need to be mindful in their approach towards D&I, and incorporate strategies and policies that truly promote diversity and inclusion.</li>
