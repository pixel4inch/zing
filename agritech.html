                    <p class=" m-0"> Enterprises in the agri-food sector have been applying innovations at various levels and for different purposes. Modern technology is being used for streamlining business processes for gaining competitive edge and at the same time seen as the ideal way forward for establishing robust relationships with consumers. Data is being digitized for achieving cost and time efficiencies. By going digital, agricultural organizations started realizing the value present in the huge volumes of agri-related big data. Data at the farm-level, derived using different sources, including sensors, mobile-based apps, drones, machinery, farm implements, robotic devices and such other IoT devices, could be processed. The interpretations, when used along with weather-based and satellite information, enables agriculturists to effectively monitor crop growth in the real-time, make performance assessments, and estimate output of each plot with highest level of accuracy, in what is called ‘precision agriculture’. Precision agriculture currently is also presenting opportunities for deployment of more advanced technologies such as AI for further optimizing farm processes. AI allows agriculturists to translate raw data into useful information for helping improve harvest both in volume and value terms. Producers are being empowered by AI even in choosing the right crop varieties, most suitable for climate in their region, and leverage automation technologies for minimizing resource usage. When the overall process of production is digitalized, right from the production and harvest up to storage and distribution, the communication between agri-ecosystem stakeholders improves. Visibility into supply chain would be enhanced and the entire process becomes highly efficient and transparent. </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class=" m-0">The global agri-sector’s future therefore would be all about smart farming. This concept can already be seen fast emerging in several countries across the world. It implies use of IoT, drones, AI, robotics and other sophisticated technologies for increasing quality and quantity of agri-products and optimizing human labor. IoT in agriculture provides means for making simple, the most tedious tasks. Technologies that are most used by farmers today are sensors, software, connectivity, location technologies, robotics and data analytics. The different sensors include temperature management, humidity, light, water and soil sensors while the software solutions are specialized applications targeting applications-agnostic IoT platforms or farm types. LoRa and cellular are the connectivity technologies being used while satellite and GPS technologies are employed for connectivity. Robotic processing facilities and autonomous tractors are a few examples demonstrating increasing robotics usage in the sector. And, there are also several standalone data analytics solutions specific for the agri sector. All these tools are allowing farmers to monitor fields in the real time and arrive at strategic decisions concerning crop management, without having to step inside the field. IoT has been the major driving force behind smart farming, by connecting sensors and machines on farms and making the overall farming process fully automated and data-driven. And, data constitutes the core of IoT. IoT devices installed across the farm collect data and process it in repetitive cycles enabling farmers to quickly respond to issues and changes.  The cycle followed by smart farming includes observation, diagnostics, decision making, and response. Sensors observe data which is fed into a cloud hosted IoT platform in which there are pre-defined decision models and rules (business logic) for ascertaining conditions of examined objects and recognizing needs/deficiencies. Once the issues have been diagnosed, the IoT platform’s ML-driven components determine the response and following evaluation of end-user, the cycle repeats.  </p>
                    <br />

                    <p class=" m-0">IoT is therefore being touted as holding the potential to revolutionize agriculture by bringing about farming automation and precision farming. Precision farming represents the umbrella concept for all agri-IoT based approaches through which farming becomes more accurate and controlled. Cattle and plants in such farming get machine-determined, best treatment. Decisions would be made per animal or plant or per sq.mt. rather than for an entire field. It enables measuring field variations precisely so that farmers are able to increase even the effectiveness of fertilizers and pesticides. Selective use of fertilizers and pesticides is possible. In the case of livestock farming, the techniques of precision farming allow farmers to monitor individual animal’s needs and accordingly adjust nutrition, which greatly improves herd health. Wireless IoT applications are already being used by farm owners for monitoring health and location of cattle. Sick animals can be easily identified and separated from rest of the herd for preventing disease spread. There are also now IoT-driven, smart greenhouses which can allow intelligent monitoring and climate control. The need for human intervention can be drastically reduced. The different sensors deployed measure various environmental parameters based on specific crop requirements, and the data collected is stored in cloud-based platforms, where it is processed and controlled with limited human intervention. Another important smart farming technique lately, had been the drones. The agri-sector has been employing drones for different purposes including assessment of crop health, crop monitoring, irrigation, spraying, soil & field analysis and planting. Drones collect visual, thermal and multispectral imagery on their flights, which provide producers with useful insights into different metrics including plant counting, plant health indices, yield production, measurement of plant height, canopy cover and field water-pond mapping, measurement of stockpile, scouting reports, nitrogen content in crops, chlorophyll measurement, and mapping of weeds among others. Furthermore, IoT smart farming’s application is not limited to large scale farming operations. The techniques are being increasingly used in organic farming and family farming, and in breeding specific cultures or cattle type for preservation of high-quality breeds. </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="m-0">Nonetheless, smart farming techniques would be more useful only when they are implemented for resolving global food problems. The EC project IoF2020 or Internet of Food 2020 is part of the Horizon 2020 Industrial Leadership. The project explores the potential of many IoT technologies through regular conferences and research projects, for the European farming and food industry. IoT-driven agriculture and smart farming have also been encouraging the Third Green Revolution. It encompasses application of data-driven technologies like precision farming, IoT, UAVs, robotics, and big data analytics among others. One of the major consequences of this revolution would be the reduced used of fertilizers and pesticides. IoT technologies would also enable better traceability of food for improved food safety. IoT-driven and smart agriculture would also benefit the environment through use of less water and optimized use of other inputs. </p>

                    <p class=" m-0">Digital agriculture constitutes the coming together of traditional farming practices and digital technology. A digital farm is more efficient and sustainable compared to the conventional one. Since the past few years, digital agriculture or agriculture 4.0 had been equipping farmers with a variety of data management tools and automation solutions for resource optimization and enhanced productivity. Technological innovations have been helping farmers to switch from the time-consuming traditional processes to cost-efficient operations. Digital agriculture is also anticipated to help nations reach SDGs by ensuring resilient and more sustainable agri-food systems. It can modernize farming and create increased value for all stakeholders in the agriculture ecosystem. It can deliver nutritious food to the growing global population. </p>

                    <br />
                    <p class="m-0">Innovations in agricultural practices and technologies are critical for feeding the continuously growing world population. Among the major, cutting-edge agricultural technologies helping nations address the food issue are agriculture drones, precision agriculture, data analytics, cloud computing and vertical farming. These technologies are touted as enabling farmers better utilize resources, labor and land and optimize production. </p>

                    <br/>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>	IoT Technology-based Sensors -</strong> Intensive effort, labor, time and equipment are needed for monitoring crops in conventional agriculture but in modern day smart farming, IoT offers means to get things done quickly. IoT devices contain sensors which collect data and present such data in the real time through mobile applications and other means. Various farming activities like sensing soil humidity and temperature, tracking livestock and plants and several others, are performed by the sensors in IoT devices. They also enable monitoring of farms remotely. IoT-based irrigation systems automate delivery of water to crops. Evapotranspiration sensors, rain sensors, and sensors for on-site soil moisture monitoring are a few examples. Several startups are currently focused on developing innovative solutions that combine the technology of IoT with computer imaging, robots and drones for increasing precision, accuracy and agility of farming processes.  Agrila, a startup based in Bulgaria developed an IoT sensor station that enables sensing of moisture and temperature of soil, wind direction and speed, solar irradiation, humidity and rain among other vital parameters. A startup based in Canada, called Farmer’s Hive, developed IoT-technology based sensors for greenhouses, fruit growers and family farms. The startup also offers the service of remote monitoring in wireless ecosystem through WiFi, LoRaWAN and LTE-M connectivity technologies, enabling farmers obtain timely insights into issues.  </li>
                      <li><strong>	Robotics to Reduce Manual Labor for Producers -</strong> Labor shortage is a critical issue that farmers today face and when the operations are spread across hundreds of acres, such labor issues are only amplified. Companies across the world therefore, have been focused on manufacturing robots for the agricultural sector, for assisting farmers in various farm related, mundane activities such as planting, harvesting, fruit-picking, spraying, transplanting, weeding and seeding among others. Robots perform such repetitive tasks with great accuracy. There are now semi-autonomous and autonomous tractors helping in harvesting. Auto-steer technology integrated tractors allow easy navigation across vast fields. Livestock is also being managed using automated systems and robots. Automated incubators, weighing scales, automated feeders and milking machines are a few examples. These automated machines also prevent manual errors to a great extent. Advanced. Farm is a US based startup and the company has been using robotics for creating autonomous navigation and harvesting solutions. The company’s robotic harvesters are integrated with stereo cameras with the help of which, fresh produce, depending on the ripeness and size, is identified and picked.  Robotic weeder is being offered by a Canadian startup called Nexus Robotics. Called Le Chevre, the robot is able to detect and eliminate weeds. It uses cameras and DL algorithms for differentiating between crops and weeds.</li>
                      <li><strong>	AI Provides Real-Time Insights into Crop Conditions -</strong> AI is being incorporated in agricultural tools for enabling farmers obtain insights into field conditions in the real-time, allowing them to respond proactively. Predictive insights offered by AI & ML algorithms automate the process of disease and anomaly recognition in livestock and plants. When diseases are detected in a timely manner, corrective action can be taken proactively. ML algorithms are also being deployed by biotechnology for recommendations in gene selection. AI in the future, would be used in several applications in the agriculture sector, beyond crops. For instance, it would be used for providing farmers with easy finance access.  Arwa Intelligence, a startup based in the US, has been using AI for providing customized crop planning recommendations to farmers. Software interface created by the startup aggregates farm data and performs detailed analysis of soil, fertility, yield, harvest, climate and genetics and offers farmers farm-level reports.  A Belgian startup called Ask Attis provides the service of disease detection for crops, through an app called Planticus. This AI-powered mobile application identifies pests and diseases in plants. Farmers would be able to secure crops by taking proactive action before major damage occurs.</li>
                      <li><strong>	Drones Make Monitoring Large Fields Easier -</strong> UAVs or drones aid farmers overcome the hassle of monitoring large fields. They collect data which is translated into useful insights. Cameras equipped on the drones facilitate surveying of far-stretched fields and obtaining aerial imaging. Using such data farmers can optimize fertilizer application and irrigation. Livestock tracking is also facilitated by drones. Grazing monitoring and geofencing are a few other applications for which drones are being used currently. There have been several startups working on developing drones that can measure weed pressure, chlorophyll levels, chemical composition and soil mineral composition among other parameters. However, droners are not suitable for monitoring poultry farms due to the noise they generate while flying. An Omani company called Wakan Tech has been creating drones for date palm tree aerial pollination. The startup developed drones that can monitor crop health and perform targeted pollen and pesticide spraying. Equinox’s Drones, an Indian startup, has been using drone technology for providing various agricultural services including aerial crop inspection, crop surveillance, data analysis and data processing among others. </li>
                      <li><strong>	Precision Agriculture Gains Traction -</strong> Precision agriculture is a sustainable agriculture method. It is a site-specific livestock and crop management method in which producer uses the most exact amounts of materials/inputs including fertilizers, pesticides and water, for improving yield both in terms of quantity and quality. Different stretches of the same field have varying soil properties and may receive different levels of sunlight. Same treatment for the entire farm would be inefficient resulting in wastage of resources and time. Agritech startups therefore have been focused on developing precision agriculture solutions for improving profitability and addressing challenges pertaining to sustainability of farming. Data Farming is a startup based in Australia that has been creating digital solutions for precision agriculture, using pay-per-use, cloud services. The cloud platform offered by the company, called the Digital Agronomist, comprises tools including soil mapping, satellite images, and auto-zone among others, which enable farmers obtain actionable insights. Agricolus is a startup from Italy. The company has been developing precision farming tools that deploy drones and satellites for estimating parameters including water stress and chlorophyll quantity among others. </li>
                      <li><strong>	Agricultural Biotechnology for Improving Livestock and Crop Quality -</strong> Use of agrochemicals is not considered ideal as these are not sustainable. Instead, scientific techniques such as plant breeding, genetic engineering, tissue culture and hybridization allow identification of better plant traits. The genome editing technology, CRISPR-Cas9, enables high target specificity and improves precision and speed. It enables production of transgenic plants with several desired qualities such as drought tolerance, disease tolerance, high-yield capacity and pest resistance among others. There are currently, several startups leveraging such agri-biotechnology methods for developing innovating solutions like biofertilizers, bioplastics, biopesticides and bioherbicides for addressing concerns like soil toxicity and others and ensuring limited negative impact on environment.  A Canadian agricultural biotechnology startup called AgGene is exploiting techniques of plant breeding for developing tissues and seeds comprising high protein content. The startup is able to manipulate genes for accumulating proteins and is therefore seen as holding the potential to address the issue of rapid increase in plant protein demand worldwide. XytoVet, is an Australian startup that has been developing cattle breeding, aquaculture and sheep breeding techniques. The company’s DNA technology is able to assign the precise parentage to cattle and sheep, helping farmers quickly identify good flock. </li>
                      <li><strong>	Big Data and Analytics Enabling Farmers Identify Hidden Relationships and Patterns -</strong> Statistics pertaining to a season’s crop production, crop area, land use, agricultural prices, crop diseases and weather forecasts would be the foundation on which the next season of farming depends. Big data and analytics tools use this data for extracting information relevant to farming operations and this allows farmers identify relationships which may otherwise stay hidden. Several solutions have been developed by many startups in the recent years, for farm analytics, allowing farmers to make the best use of field data. A startup based in India, called Fyllo, uses cloud services for analyzing farm data. Devices of the company are installed throughout the farm for sensing. Models are built with data secured in the real-time. AgriData Innovations, a Dutch startup has been facilitating farm data collection, analysis and visualization. The solution is most suitable for greenhouses. It also employs image processing and neural networks for measuring leaf size and crop health among other parameters for improving greenhouse operations and productivity. </li>
                      <li><strong>	Sustainable CEA Techniques’ Usage Increasing -</strong> Weather is always fluctuating and this hampers traditional farming methods greatly. Also, growing crops in deserts, urban locations and in other places with unfavorable conditions poses challenges. CEA or Controlled Environment Agriculture overcomes such challenges. In this, producers subject the plants to controlled light, nutrients, humidity and temperature proportions. The different CEA growing environments in practice currently include indoor farming, greenhouses, and vertical farming in which techniques such as aeroponics and hydroponics are deployed for growing plants without soil and in steam or liquid medium. Aquaponics is a technique in which fish and plants are simultaneously cultivated. This is another CEA form. The plants take in nutrients provided by fish in this growing technique. On their part, the plants purify water. Using such sustainable CEA methods producers can reduce diseases and increase yield.  OnePointOne, a startup in the US, has been building vertical plane aeroponics. Vertical farming techniques are being deployed for space-, labor-, and water-saving. The company also deploys hyperspectral high resolution imagery for analyzing plants and provides personalized nutrition and other farming services to agriculturists.  Baltic Freya, a startup from Lithuania, developed an improved technique of fogponics. Existing fogponics tend to overheat nutrient solutions leading to cracking of piezoceramic discs. Fogponics 2.0 developed by Baltic Freya ensures generation of optimum amounts of fog which does not overheat solutions or crack discs.</li>
                      <li><strong>	Regenerative Agriculture for Limited Disturbance to Soil -</strong> Conventional agriculture results in erosion and soil crusting in the long run. Tilling, overgrazing, ploughing etc., do not allow time for revival of the soil, before the subsequent cropping season. Addressing this issue is regenerative agriculture that causes limited soil disturbance and at the same time focuses on improving topsoil revival and soil biodiversity. Regenerative agriculture involves practices such as reduced tillage, no-till farming, and crop rotation among others. These practices allow fields to become carbon sinks through sequestration, leading to fewer emissions of carbon into atmosphere. A Dutch startup called Freesoil developed a plant based, high quality compost extract which is selected by plants, naturally. The compost extract adds microorganisms to soil for improving symbiosis between microbes and plants and resulting in nutrient-rich soils. Acterra, a Canadian startup, developed a technology of fermenting composting, soil, seed and other residues. The company also developed an additive for accelerating breakdown of matter. </li>
                      <li><strong>	Connectivity Technologies for Connected Farms -</strong> Satellite-enabled communication, rural broadband, LPWAN and 5G are the connectivity technologies which facilitate smart farming. IoT devices, sensors, and robots are deployed with the help of 5G. These technologies allow communication at high speeds. Farmers are able to monitor data in the real-time and more accurately. Fiber optic cables-enabled high speed internet helps in field data exchange in the real-time. Ellenex, an Australian startup, provides several sensor products powered by low-power satellite, LoRaWAN, low power WiFi, Sigfox and other connectivity technologies. The network technologies aid battery powered devices deployed in the fields, for measuring water quality, temperature, flow, pressure etc. A US-based startup called AgriLinx developed a LoRaWAN network called FLEX for providing low bandwidth data coverage for up to five miles heling farmers access data on mobile devices for tracking farm equipment and irrigation among other aspects. </li>

                    <p>Digital agriculture would deliver major changes in productivity, sustainability and efficiency in farming, across the entire value chain. The sensing systems along with the analytics enable farmers make informed and timely decisions for more predictable outcomes. However, digital agriculture at the same time brings forth several technical, practical, ethical, social and economic questions with major implications for how the global commercial agriculture sector is structured and governed. What would be the implication of such a rapid-paced digitalization of agricultural knowledge is a major question that needs to be answered. Here are some industry trends to watch out for in 2023.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Automation and Precision Farming - The global agriculture industry would increasingly embrace new and innovative farming techniques for reducing the enormous negative environmental impact it has been creating with its industrial scale production. Expanding farming operations in order to feed the rapidly increasing global population is being detrimental to the environment. Automation, precision farming and such other innovative farming approaches would therefore be increasingly adopted for reducing this negative impact. Mechanical improvements like larger and better working agricultural equipment or use of genetic advances including better seed and more effective fertilizers and pesticides among others were the highlights of previous farming evolutions, but going forward, increased use of digital tools would bring out the new transformation. Automation that includes use of autonomous farming machinery, drones and robots would significantly increase efficiency of farming operations. Precision farming includes VR (variable rate) application of pesticides, fertilizers and irrigation, based on crop needs, instead of uniform application at pre-scheduled frequencies and times. The approach would also save enormous amounts of time and cost for agriculturists. </li>
                      <li>Increasing prominence of urban farming would be another important trend to look out for in the years ahead. The localized farming approach is being developed for producing closer to consumers thus reducing the number of food miles and saving costs. Vertical farming, which represents the practice of crop growing in vertical layers and hydroponics or the use of nutrient rich water for growing plants are a few other techniques are seen as holding considerable potential in reducing the negative effects from haphazardly expanding farming activities in rural areas. Newark boasts of the vertical farm which is the largest in the world so far. This AerfoFarm’s project demonstrated the possibility of large scale vertical farming with exceptional results. Productivity of the farm is 400 times higher per/sq. ft. compared to a field farm.  </li>
                      <li>Environment-friendly Ways for Creating Meat - A third of the farm lands in the world currently is used for growing the feed needed for livestock. The enormous amounts of resources it consumes has led to several companies lately, focus their efforts on finding new ways for creating meat and redirect that land for growing crops needed by humans instead. Plant-based meats and cultured or lab-grown meats were developed in the recent years as alternatives to conventional meat from livestock. Plant-based meats are already witnessing increased penetration. Burger king and such other food chains have already started offering plant-based products. Another success story had been that of Beyond meat, The company seen the most successful IPO when it went public recently. All these examples suggest the huge growth potential for meat alternatives. By the end of this decade, these alternatives could make up for about 10% of the overall meat industry globally. An alternative to plant based meat again is the cultured meat that is same as the real meat genetically but cultured from animal cells. This is real meat but without the animal slaughter and factory farms being involved. However, cultured meat is still new. Both the regulators and consumers are required to come around this idea of real meat alternative. However, there are signs that the market is slowly beginning to accept the concept. For instance, cultured meat was approved for sale in Singapore in 2020. 3D printed food is another innovative idea which is touted as holding potential to play a major role in food production in the future. NovaMeat, a Spanish company, was successful in creating a 3D printed meat piece which mimics the real meat’s fibrous nature and other characteristics perfectly. </li>
                      <li>Technology for Water Management for Saving the Precious Resource - In areas with inadequate rainfall, irrigation is critical for providing crops with water for making them arable. However, while irrigation is important, several farmers continue to irrigate fields wastefully. Flood irrigation has been identified as wasting more than 60% of the water through overwatering. Overwatering also affects plant growth. Another danger with excess irrigation is the water carrying fertilizers into lakes and streams contaminating other water sources. There are however, technologies that enable farmers provide water to crops in a sustainable manner. N-Drip for instance, is a micro drip system of irrigation that enables supply of water to the roots of the plants, slowly. The irrigation system creates the right growing environment for plants and at the same time reduces usage of water by about 50%.</li>
                      <li>Vertical Farming for Reducing Farm Miles - Vertical farming uses aeroponics and hydroponics for producing faster production of higher yields. It is a commercial farming system in which animals, plants, fungi and such other forms of life are cultivated for various purposes including food, fiber and fuel among others. The plants in this approach are stacked vertically, one above the other. In urban high-rise structures, vertical farming allows large-scale agriculture. Cultivation of vegetables, fruits, fuel-producing plants, medicinal plants and other plants at large scales is made possible with vertical farming. Sales of such produce also happen directly in the cities, thus reducing need for transportation. Water resources can also be efficiently utilized in vertical farming. A 9300 m2 vertical farm, with about thirty stories, would be able to provide 2000 kcal nutrition/day to around 15 thousand people. </li>
                      <li>Currently, three kinds of vertical farming are in use including the underground vertical farming, open air farming and farming in sky scrapers in closed systems. The underground vertical farming method is practiced in the Netherlands currently. The open air method is where farming is done in mixed-use sky scrapers. It is a sustainable farming approach done for community and personal use. The farming category is also used for growing produce for sale commercially. A modified type of the same concept is where crops are cultivated in the sky scrapers’ periphery so that plants receive adequate sunlight. In the third category, plants are cultivated in sky scrapers, in closed systems. These systems are presently under trial in London and Singapore. </li>
                      <li>One of the major advantages with vertical farming is the increased production of crops. It allows year-round crop production, notwithstanding environmental conditions. A single high-rise farm can be equal to 450 conventional horizontal farms. Vertical framing is also considered ideal for producing organic crops, in large-scale. Cultivation is possible without the usage of chemical pesticides. Natural resources can be recycled and conserved through the aeroponics and hydroponics which consume less water than what is used in traditional agriculture. Waste from urban sewage can be used as compost in this farming approach. By reducing dependence on land, vertical farming can help in forest regrowth. Since less equipment is used, CO2 emissions also decrease. When applied holistically and combined with other innovative farming technologies, vertical farming enables sustainable urban development. However, vertical farming would not replace traditional farming as this is still needed for growing several other crops for which indoor farming is not suitable. </li>
                      <li>Sustainable Agriculture for Environmental Preservation and Food Security - Sustainable agriculture preserves the environment, expands natural resources of the Earth and creates quality life for humans and animals. It allows the society’s desires for food and clothing needs to be sustainably met, without inhibiting natural resources of the Earth. Sustainable agriculture helps maintain quality of soil, reduces erosion and preserves water. For achieving sustainable agriculture, farmers must focus on specific criteria which aim at creating healthy environment and at the same time ensure profitability. A key sustainable agriculture trend currently is the increasing focus on creating alternative options for food. Veganism is an example. It eliminates animal-based products in human diets and aims at protecting and preserving animals. Leading the way here are companies like Beyond Meat. The company creates burgers which taste like meat but do not use any animal products. Beyond Meat uses protein, trace minerals, water and fat for creating the alternative that looks and tastes like meat. These four building blocks are derived from plants. Creating meat without animal products needs fewer resources thus making the process sustainable. </li>
                      <li>The brutal practice of factory farming, in which farm animals are treated with cruelty, if reduced, can also mean sustainable agriculture. The conventional farming practice comprises of packing animals in large numbers in small cages for preserving farm space. The practice involves not just animal mistreatment but also leads to more rapid spread of diseases.  Sustainable agriculture however, tries to create humane environments for those animals by minimizing animal numbers per farm, allowing sufficient space for the animals to freely roam. </li>
                      <li>Minichromosome Technology to Eliminate the Need for Genetic Modification of Plants - Pests would be one of the major problems for agriculturists in the coming years. Over the years there have been several farming advancements that aimed at reducing this concern however, most of those methods faced flak. Genetically modified foods for instance, are seen as increasing health risks to people. GM food production is also linked to disruption of natural biodiversity and increasing toxins content in soil. However, as an alternative to these methods of food production, that are ridden with issues, the technology of minichromosome emerged. Agricultural geneticists could apply this technology or improving traits of plants, without having to alter in any way, their genes. Tiny amounts of genetic material present in the minichromosomes help in making plants more pest resistant and drought tolerant and importantly, they do not interfere with the natural development of the host. Genetic engineers would be able to develop crops requiring fewer fertilizers, fungicides, pesticides, and other chemicals that harm the soil and environment. Bio-fortification could also be achieved and the method could also improve nutritional content of the plant. </li>
                      <li>Increased Proliferation of Crop Management Software - There is currently a technology solution for about everything a farmer faces in operations. Farm management software for instance, constitutes the integrated platform providing information in the real-time for assisting farmers with their daily routine. Daily farm activities can now be easily tracked. Monitoring and reporting software solutions help farmers make informed decisions. There are currently, ERP solutions allowing farmers streamline processes and achieve seamless collaborations. Farmers are now able to manage supply chain procurement, processing and finance all from one place. Proliferation of such farm management software would increase in the years ahead.</li>
