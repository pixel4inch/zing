                  <p class=" m-0">The global battery technology market growth is witnessing burgeoning  growth, driven by increasing use of EVs and hybrid vehicles, growing consumer interest in electronics, and more stringent government regulations on harmful emissions. The value of this market is expected to grow exceed US$150 billion by 2025. The Li-ion battery is expected to register the best growth rate, due to its use in several applications and potential for further development. The stupendous rise in the sale of electric cars in recent times is attributed to the cost reductions enabled by the advancements in Li-ion battery technology. The cost of a Li-ion battery pack declined by 85% between 2010 and 2018, and the average price of this battery pack is anticipated to be less than $100/kWh by 2030. In the massive shift from fossil fuel to electrical energy, the need for more efficient batteries for industrial, power, and transport applications is growing at a faster rate than ever before.</p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">When designing batteries, major EV manufacturers including Ford, Porsche, Tesla, BMW, GM, and Honda consider capacity, charging times, chemistry aspects, degradation, and safety. Vehicle manufacturers constantly tweak their cell and module sizes for achieving optimum performance levels. The high-voltage battery systems used in EVs need battery management systems (BMS) that are meticulously designed to ensure optimal power and safety. Tesla’s latest battery packs contain several thousand 2170 Lithium-ion cells, which are more energy efficient by 10 to 15% than the Panasonic 18650 cells in previous models. Similarly, Porsche Taycan, Porsche’s high-performing EV, includes a 93.4kWh battery that could produce 800V, as compared to the standard 400V produced in many other electric vehicles. This battery comprises 33 battery modules, each with 12 cells, totally capable of storing 235.8 Wh/cell. Toyota leads in hybrid solutions with its most popular Prius, the PHEV with an 8.8 kWh battery pack, enabling nearly 55 MPG within city roads. There are also many other manufacturers who offer models with systems with varying battery capacity and battery utilization. </p>

                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">The need for uninterrupted electricity is anticipated to increase due to the steady expansion in population, development of infrastructure, and fast-paced industrialization. Also, against the backdrop of growing concerns over global warming and climate change, the heavy dependence on fossil fuel has and still continues to attract attention, forcing governments the world over to legislate policies that mandate utilities to integrate renewable energy into the existing energy generation mix. Integrating and balancing high shares of renewable energy with very modest changes to power system requires the use of energy storage systems given the intermittent nature of renewable energy. In addition to their variability, renewable energy sources are also located far away from clusters of urban population. The need of the hour for meeting renewable integration as supplemental power sources is therefore the ability to store this energy as save for future use for meeting peak load demands. Governments therefore are providing funding and financing support for energy storage projects. Economies of scale are boosting growth of battery energy storage systems. The decreasing cost of energy storage batteries is also expected to fuel their adoption. The market is also likely to gain from favorable government policies, increasing use of battery systems as an off-grid energy source in the transportation and telecommunication sectors as well as fast advancement in grid storage infrastructure.</p>


                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Other futuristic applications include drones and Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) planes. With a wide range of applications from energy storage grids and electric cars to flying vehicles and soliculture, new battery technologies are expected to transform the relationship of people with energy, and bring the world closer to becoming totally eco-friendly. </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong> Solid-state Batteries - </strong>Different approaches are likely to be seen in the
                      manufacture of EV batteries over the coming years. One important development is the solid-state
                      batteries. A liquid electrolyte which shuttles charge around is used in the lithium-ion batteries
                      and ceramic, a solid material is likely to replace this liquid in solid-state batteries. This
                      replacement unlocks immense possibilities which can pack more energy within a smaller space,
                      improving ranges of electric vehicles. Shorter charging time is also required for solid-state
                      batteries as they can move around charge much faster. As solvents in electrolytes are flammable,
                      solid-state batteries can reduce this risk and improve safety.</li>
                    <li><strong> Lithium-Metal Batteries- </strong> The novel lithium-metal batteries are likely to
                      drive the switch to EVs much faster, making EVs as cheap and convenient as gas vehicles.
                      Quantumscape, focusing on this technology has pumped in a lot of money before going public in the
                      year 2020. The company has tied up with Volkswagen to fit its batteries in their cars by the year
                      2025 but there are manufacturing challenges as lithium-metal batteries degrade over time. Solid
                      Power is another player like Quantumscape who has reached major milestones this year</li>
                    <li><strong> Sodium-ion batteries - </strong> Another new technology, Sodium-ion batteries are
                      closely competing with solid-state batteries. These are similar to lithium-ion batteries but use
                      sodium as their main chemical ingredient instead of lithium. CATL, the Chinese battery giant plans
                      to begin mass production in the year 2023. Sodium-ion batteries can cut costs as they depend on a
                      cheaper, easily available material when compared to lithium-ion chemistries but may not
                      necessarily improve performance. As it is not certain if these batteries will be able to meet EV’s
                      demands, US-based Natron is targeting these for applications meant for micro mobility devices such
                      as scooters and e-bikes and stationary storage.</li>
                    <li><strong> Organosilicon Electrolyte Batteries - </strong> A major risk with lithium batteries is
                      chances of the electrolyte exploding or catching fire. Looking for something safer, chemistry
                      professors, Robert Hamers and Robert West of University of Wisconson-Madison developed liquid
                      solvents based on organosilicon (OS). These electrolytes could be engineered at molecular level to
                      be used as Li-ion batteries by the military, industries, and consumers as well.</li>
                    <li><strong> Lithium-Sulphur - </strong> Lithium-Sulphur could be another promising technology,
                      capable of replacing heavy metals in batteries. A team of researchers at Monash University
                      developed a Lithium-Sulphur-based battery design that could be used in car applications, and
                      theoretically demonstrated to store more energy by a factor of 6 than Lithium-ion batteries. </li>
                    <li><strong> NanoBolt Lithium Tungsten Batteries - </strong> NanoBolt lithium tungsten batteries are
                      known to store more energy and are faster. Researchers working at N1 Technologies, Inc. included
                      tungsten and carbon multi-layered nanotubes which bonded to the copper anode substrate to build a
                      web-like nano structure, giving ions a large surface area to attach to during recharging and
                      discharging cycles. Nanotubes could also be cut to suit any lithium battery design.</li>
                    <li><strong> Zinc-manganese Oxide Batteries - </strong> Looking into conventional assumptions
                      regarding how batteries work, a team from DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory unexpectedly
                      found a chemical conversion reaction in zinc-manganese oxide batteries. They realized that if this
                      process could be controlled it could increase the energy density in normal batteries without a
                      cost increase. This made such batteries a likely alternative for lead acid and lithium-ion
                      batteries, specifically meant for large-scale storage of energy which supported a nation’s
                      electricity grid. </li>
                    <li><strong> Glass Battery - </strong> Glass battery technology, which is another promising concept,
                      involves adding lithium or sodium to glass to create an electrode within the battery. In mobility
                      applications, this could better handle extreme temperature, ensure more stability, less expensive
                      to produce than other sources, capable of storing 3 times the energy of a Li-ion battery of the
                      same size, and could withstand more charge/ discharge cycles than other EV batteries.</li>
                    <li><strong> Gold Nanowire Gel Electrolyte Batteries - </strong> Gels are known to be less
                      combustible when compared to liquids and this is what researchers at University of California,
                      Irvine experimented with. Gold nanowires were coated with manganese dioxide and then covered with
                      electrolyte gel. Generally, nanowires are too delicate for use in batteries but these were more
                      resilient. When charged, researchers found that the resulting electrode was able to go through
                      200,000 cycles and still hold the charge whereas a conventional battery could hold only 6,000
                      cycles. </li>
                    <li><strong> TankTwo String Cell™ batteries - </strong> For electric vehicles (EVs), the slow
                      recharging process was a barrier. Wanting to change hours into minutes, TankTwo modularized a
                      battery. Containing a collection of small independent, self-organizing cells was their String
                      Cell™ battery which was covered by a conductive material which allowed to form contacts easily and
                      quickly with others. There was an internal processing unit which controlled connections of the
                      electrochemical cell. For quick charging of EVs, little balls within the battery were sucked out
                      and exchanged for recharged cells and charging could be done at a service station during non-peak
                      hours also.</li>

                  <p class=" m-0">How things would play out in 2023 and beyond will be largely driven by certain key
                    trends in the area of corporate diversity, in addition to the actions that leaders would take around
                    these trends.</p>
                  <br />

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Lowering Costs:</strong> It is a cost game for lithium-ion battery
                      manufacturers as they look to lower costs by changing chemistries. Cathodes are the most expensive
                      part of a battery and the nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cathode is the dominant one in EV
                      batteries. Cutting down on these costs along with the lithium cost could help decrease overall
                      cost. A breakthrough alternative could be the lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode material which
                      is low cost. The global semiconductor industry could get fragmented ultimately due to the
                      aggressive, new policies of the US which are to be tested this year. The improvements being done
                      to the LFP batteries might quickly increase their market share to 40% as far as the EV market is
                      concerned. LFP batteries are already being used by Tesla and automakers Volkswagen and Ford have
                      announced their plan to offer EV models with these batteries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Graphite Emerges as a Promising Material -</strong> Battery researchers generally tend
                      to concentrate on cathode chemistries but anodes are also being considered. Graphite is used in
                      most anodes of lithium-ion batteries to hold the ions but alternatives such as silicon can help
                      speed up charging and increase energy density. Silicon anodes were researched for a long time but
                      didn’t have a long life in products. Sila, a startup started production of silicon anodes for
                      batteries used in wearable, fitness devices. The Department of Energy has recently given them a
                      grant of $100 million to build a manufacturing unit in Moses Lake, Washington. Sila will partner
                      Mercedes-Benz to produce material for EV batteries from the year 2025.There are other startups
                      blending silicon and graphite to make anodes. OneD Battery Sciences in partnership with Sionic
                      Energy and GM are likely to commercialize these anodes this year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Policies influence the EV Battery Technologies Space -</strong> A funding of $370
                      billion for clean climate and energy, along with billions for EV and battery manufacturing was set
                      aside as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in the year 2022. The IRA is
                      providing grants and loans to US battery manufacturers to boost their capacity. EV tax credits in
                      the law also incentivize automakers to either source material locally or from manufacturers and
                      free-trade partners from North America. As a result, automakers will find novel ways of sourcing
                      material to announce their manufacturing capacities. As battery materials are likely to be in
                      short supply, recycling facilities could help fill the gaps. This means there is going to be
                      greater demand for the main ingredients of lithium-ion batteries namely nickel, cobalt, and
                      lithium itself. An outcome of the IRA incentive could also be a growing interest in battery
                      recycling. Though EVs will not come off the road due to shortage of crucial material, recycling
                      has started to gain momentum. Chinese companies such as CATL are leaders in battery recycling but
                      major growth is likely to be seen in other EV markets such as Europe and North America. Toronto
                      headquartered Li-Cycle and Nevada-based Redwood Materials are in the process of building
                      facilities to separate and purify important battery metals such as nickel and lithium to be
                      reused. Li-Cycle is commissioning its recycling facility this year and Redwood Materials has
                      started production of its copper foil from its plant in Nevada and has also announced plans to
                      build a second unit in Charleston, South Carolina. Policies and a flood of money from IRA are
                      likely to fuel the demand for EV batteries this year which will be an important year to monitor
                      closely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stationary Grid Storage –</strong> A Growing Market for Battery Technologies - The
                      market meant for stationary grid storage is small and not as large as the EV battery market but
                      the demand is increasing for renewable power sources such as solar and wind which is variable
                      resources and such batteries can help with storage when needed. Even though lithium-ion batteries
                      are used for this purpose, it is not ideal for stationary storage. The primary goal for stationary
                      storage is to cut costs whereas for EVs they are required to be smaller, faster and lighter.
                      Another material which is coming up for stationary storage is iron. Form Energy and ESS are
                      developing iron-air batteries. Form Energy with its facility in Weirton, West Virginia uses a
                      water-based electrolyte and stores energy with the use of reversible rusting whereas ESS
                      headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon is making a different type, deploying a similar chemistry.
