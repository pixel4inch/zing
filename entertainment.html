                  <p class=" m-0">Global video games market continues to grow at a healthy rate, surpassing revenues of
                    music industry and box office revenues. Video gaming revenues are dependent completely on consumer
                    spending levels, although the business model has change considerably in the recent times. Unlike
                    earlier times, present day consumers tend to purchase fewer games but spend greater time on these
                    games. Consequently, the business model is shifting towards recurring type of revenues being
                    generated by active user base, which contrasts to the earlier model that relied on sales of single
                    units. Due to this changing business model, the focus on video game industry players is on
                    increasing the per user engagement rates. For this, companies are looking to develop highly engaging
                    games and also looking to adopt innovative in-game monetization opportunities. The integration of
                    additional downloadable content such as expansion packs, characters, tools, and new features present
                    gaming companies with added avenues to generate revenues. Such a business model has evolved in line
                    with improvements being witnessed in Internet connectivity, especially mobile Internet services, and
                    advancements in gaming hardware, which are enabling users to gain access to a wide range of
                    high-quality games across varied platforms and devices. Mobile gaming in fact currently accounts for
                    a growing share of revenue generation for the video gaming industry. </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">The immense popularity of certain video games is expected to help them influence
                    cultural discourse, leading to live concerts, new albums and new movies. The tremendous popularity
                    of various games along with their playtime and number of active users is hard for other participants
                    to ignore. In the coming years, players across different segments of the entertainment industry are
                    anticipated to engage in partnerships, with media companies eying on the opportunity presented by
                    surge in gaming. These developments are expected to also create new growth opportunities for
                    associated industries. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to legitimatize and
                    popularize eSports, which is attributed to adoption across broadcasters, athletes and leagues
                    looking forward to engage fans. Extended shutdown for conventional sports leagues is expected to
                    drive young users towards eSports, providing the segment with a substantial customer base. Recent
                    developments also indicate that eSports is likely to emerge as mainstream option in the industry.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">Other major factors promoting growth of video games are technological advancements in
                    software and hardware, increased internet access, increased smartphone penetration, and easy access
                    to games. Developers of video games are continuously pushing their limits in the area of graphics
                    for making the games more gripping, which is anticipated to further promote market growth. Industry
                    participants are currently more focused on increasing hardware efficiency and compatibility due to
                    the increased inclination toward online games. MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online), F2P (Free2Play)

                    would also positively impact market growth over the coming years. Number of people using social
                    networking sites like Reddit and Facebook for gaming had increased tremendously in the recent years.
                    Increased availability of games in different genres including role play, action, strategy and
                    simulation, on these social networking sites, has been attracting players. There are also now
                    eSports tournaments being organized. Expanding professional gamer numbers would also lead to
                    increase in video games as well as accessories sales going forward. </p>

                    transformed the way people enjoy listening to music, and are anticipated to gain immense popularity
                    in the near future. The number of individuals utilizing the streaming services is anticipated to
                    exceed the number of individuals owning the music's physical copies by 2023. The shift toward
                    streaming services is anticipated to have a massive impact on how artists earn money and the way
                    record labels are operated. The concept of music streaming is anticipated to receive another major
                    impetus as several underpenetrated markets including Japan are reaching their tipping point. Key
                    markets such as Japan that switched late from physical to digital music have almost bypassed the
                    music download stage and transitioned directly to music streaming. The demand for streaming is also
                    fueled by intense competition and pricing pressures that are driving down overall prices. For
                    instance, as a late comer in the mobile music market, Apple Music focused on a flexible pricing
                    strategy in specific markets to compete with incumbents such as Spotify.</p>

                    unrivalled flexibility in the manner of consumption, easy access on multiple devices. The music
                    industry is therefore witnessing a remarkable transition from ownership towards digital streaming.
                    Music streaming is emerging as a perfect option for mobile music than download stores. Streaming is

                    plans such as unlimited and zero-rated data plans are encouraging users to enjoy music without

                    Video-On-Demand (VOD). Consequently, the focus is on creating new services and compatible devices
                    that can provide video content to consumers. While the amount of entertainment content becoming
                    available to audiences continues to grow rapidly, consumers also have the option of downloading or
                    streaming content over the Internet to their devices, through pay-per-view, subscription, or
                    ad-supported content viewing business models, as against depending solely on pay TV services. In the
                    present day TV Anywhere era, VOD market is recording strong growth, driven by the increasing
                    adoption of smart devices and changing consumer behaviors and video viewership patterns. With the
                    popularity of VOD content continuing to rise, Internet is proving to be a major disruption to
                    conventional TV services, compelling TV players to seek alternative measures to ensure their
                    sustenance among consumers. In the United States alone, over 45% of households have active
                    subscriptions to VOD services. Key benefits of on-demand entertainment spurring its popularity
                    include wide variety of choice, control over viewing time</p>

                    curation; in-car music streaming options; social media integration functions. For example, major
                    online music streaming providers such as Soundcloud, Spotify, and Wynk are integrating applications
                    with social media platforms such as Facebook to allow users to share playlists and music with their
                    friends & family. In the paid model, vertical integrated service providers remain popular. An
                    example of a vertically integrated paid subscription service is Apple Music. The company
                    manufactures smartphones, develops apps for its branded device, maintains a company app store and
                    also offers subscription music services. Apple has successfully leveraged and hooked up its over 1
                    billion device customers to its music service through a consolidated and unified branding strategy.

                    is the growing importance of virtual reality (VR), with the consumer spending on immersive games
                    continuing to grow around the world. The improved convenience and greater involvement and fun
                    associated with VR games compared to traditional games is contributing to the rising popularity of

                    record label's support and the ship is estimated to offer artists more control of their careers and
                    enable the artists to retain more share of what they earn.

                  </p>

                  <br />

                  <p class="m-0"><strong>Exponential Growth of Technology -</strong> The music industry is always open to novel
                    technologies and is anticipated to witness more record labels and artists adopting new tools in the
                    future. Virtual Reality or VR concerts and Augmented Reality or AR experiences are estimated to be
                    extensively popular, enabling music fans to listen to music in an entirely new way. Furthermore, the
                    usage of AI or artificial intelligence and ML or machine learning in the production of music is
                    estimated to be highly prevalent. In the Video games industry, one of the notable trends is the
                    growing importance of VR, with the consumer spending on immersive games continuing to grow around
                    the world. The improved convenience and greater involvement and fun associated with VR games

                    in the VR gaming space include AltSpaceVR and BigScreenVR. Video gaming industry is also being
                    impacted by the blockchain technology, which offers useful tools for gamers for various purposes
                    such as decentralized asset exchanges, faster and secure payments, and verification of collectibles
                    and viral objects. Blockchain is also useful in allowing developers to monetize their offerings in
                    an appropriate manner. Another trend in the market has been the emergence of cross-platform gaming,
                    which enabled players from across platforms to play games together and at the same time. </p>

                  <p class="m-0"><strong>Immersive Gaming Registers Popularity - </strong>The increasing significance of immersion is
                    reflected by growing popularity of role-playing games. Video games have posted a notable evolution
                    from simple pixels towards sophisticated graphics over the last decades. The evolution has paved way
                    for interesting elements, including detailed immersion depicted by first-person action games and
                    other options. The increasing attention of detailed immersion in the field of video games has led to
                    significant expansion of genres, with role-playing games enjoying tremendous popularity among
                    gamers. In role-playing games, players experience a storyline with a character created by gamers.
                    The character provides players with the opportunity to become a part of the story and live a virtual
                    life. These elements resulted in enhanced immersive gaming experience, mainly for action-adventure
                    games. The concept of immersive gaming received a further push from next-generation games and gears
                    such as steering wheels. The combination of virtual reality, visualization tools and 3D rendering
                    software took immersive gaming to the next level, prompting leading companies to embrace the change.
                    Immersive gaming is also influenced by the way a player moves in the virtual world and choices made
                    by gamers as the character.</p>

                    <li><strong> Cloud Music Revolutionizes the Music Industry - </strong>Cloud music is the newest delivery platform for
                      music in the entertainment industry. Cloud Music allows users to access digital music files over
                      the cloud at leisure as ‘on-demand streaming services’ over their Inter-enabled devices such as
                      smartphones, tablets, iPads and PCs. The cloud music is a step ahead of digital download services,
                      as it takes music portability and convenience to the next level by allowing users to stream music
                      anywhere and at anytime without having to worry about downloading music onto their devices. Cloud
                      music services provide users with the power of on-demand playback facility, which allows them to
                      choose and stream their favorite music on their mobile handsets rather than listen to what can be
                      referred to as radio services. Cloud music has also taken personalization of music to another
                      level, enhancing both portability and customizability for music listeners while handling their
                      music files over the Internet. Cloud music streaming technique is ideal for situations where music
                      delivery is needed instantaneously, including live broadcasts and when sampling of music files
                      prior to their purchase is required. Cloud music over a computer or other media devices requires
                      essentials such as Internet connection along with hardware such as sound card and speakers or
                      headphones. In cloud music streaming, a mere click on the music title on a website results in its
                      play instantaneously, either on the website itself or in a pop-up window.</li>
                    <li><strong> Web3 – </strong>An Emerging Technology - Web3 started influencing how the music industry operates
                      through Metaverse, despite getting started just recently. The new technology's emergence opened
                      new avenues for artists of their creative potential, and metaverse specifically offers a range of
                      channels through which artistic creativity is possibly expressed and the chance to interrelate
                      with the target audience. The music's inclusion inside the metaverse attributes to its audience
                      appeal's expansion. The customers are anticipated to save money buying a ticket to the music
                      festival on Web3 and it has been just a few years since people became familiar with Web the term
                      3.0 music scene. Web 3.0 is an exceptional financial and promotional approach that potentially has
                      considerable consequences for singers. However, web 3.0 is still behind compared to various
                      success forms that are highly established in spite of web 3.0 estimated potential influences.</li>
                    <li><strong> Growing Popularity of Wearable Devices -</strong> The growing popularity of wearable devices against
                      the backdrop of the rise of consumer grade Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem and the resulting
                      diversification of smartphone vendors into manufacturing smartwatches to provide users with a
                      connected experience, is bringing in disruptive changes in the music industry. There is the
                      growing trend of integrating cloud music streaming services in wearable devices such as
                      smartwatches. Mobile music streaming service providers are increasingly focusing on the
                      development of interfaces and applications compatible with wearable devices, allowing music
                      streaming on such device without the need for smartphones to access music. For example, Apple
                      developed Apple Watch that displays time, helps users to access maps, track health, access Wi-Fi
                      and Bluetooth, and play music by syncing with their iPhone. Spotify launched Spotify Running
                      service in the year 2015, which picks upbeat songs at the same tempo as the runner’s step rates,
                      ranging from 140-190 steps/min, using sensors on a smartphone. The running playlist is chosen
                      based on the listening history and stride rate of users. In addition, Rock My World, Inc. launched
                      Rockmyrun app that uses step rate as well as heart rate stats collected from smartwatch to select
                      a playlist from different genres, which is played during various exercises. Google also recently
                      voiced plans to launch music streaming services as part of their wearable devices. A wireless
                      communication protocol is used for communication between wearable devices and a music player.</li>
                    <li><strong> Blockchain & AI Make a Mark -</strong> On-demand streaming platforms integrate disruptive technology
                      such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), analytics, cloud, IoT, and more to
                      track the content usage pattern. The addition of features such as zero-buffering, cloud-based
                      streaming service, large content repository, and Video-on-demand to support live content have
                      simplified the use of OTT platforms. OTT media like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime depend on
                      software like Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to grab the attention of the
                      users in the first 30 seconds of the interaction phase. Through AI and machine learning, OTT
                      players can use Content-Aware Encoding (CAE) video compression to provide the best possible
                      picture with minimal bandwidth consumption. With ML and AI, OTT media uses algorithms to analyze
                      the most relevant content and experience for each user. Streaming on a blockchain is an emerging
                      technology that enables content creators you to stream media without paying any fees. Blockchain
                      live streaming is an emerging technology which allows content creators to upload content and get
                      paid immediately, regardless of the device type. Blockchain-based video streaming app development
                      has quickly become a competitive space with a number of start-ups entering the market, ranging
                      from Livepeer to YouNow.</li>
