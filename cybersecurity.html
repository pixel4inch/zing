                  <p class=" m-0">Digital information has emerged into one of the most expensive and valuable assets for
                    any company, accounting for over 50% of the total value of businesses, exceeding the cost of IT
                    hardware and software resources. The fact that most of the data generated by a company pertains to
                    key day-to-day transactions, business communications, promotional and marketing strategies,
                    financial, maintenance and administration data, product and market related data, audit trails,
                    customer and personnel data, makes ‘information’ as important as any capital asset for an
                    organization. </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class=" m-0">Consumerization of IT, globalization of businesses and workforce mobility are adding
                    to the data security challenges being faced by companies. Rising digitalization and adoption of
                    emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things and the cloud are providing lucrative
                    opportunities for cybercriminals to target different data sources for selling and using information
                    for extortion. The increasing transition towards digital technologies is changing the threat
                    landscape and prompting various cybercriminals to target in-flight data as an increasing amount of
                    data is now characterized by extended in-flight times. The scenario points towards the relevance of
                    new measures that can ensure protection beyond a single-entry point. The threat landscape is also
                    complicated by the massive transition of organizations towards remote working, exposing significant
                    volumes of in-flight data to different risks. </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Data breach incidents are expected to increase at a breakneck speed and reach record
                    levels in the coming years. Organizations and businesses are already struggling with high-profile
                    cyber-attacks that target nearly everything, from the critical infrastructure such as oil pipelines
                    and government data through to personal information of customers. Organizations of different sizes
                    are finding it extremely challenging to protect the data, both stored information and data on the
                    move. Various countries have reported an alarming increase in number of data breaches targeting
                    sensitive and critical information like Social Security numbers. In addition, various cybercriminals
                    are shifting their attention towards more focused, smaller attacks, instead of concentrating on
                    massive data. There is a notable jump in number of cyber-attacks featuring ransomware, which is
                    emerging as a preferred data breach option among cybercriminals. </p>


                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Barring the military, majority of the industries across countries are reporting a
                    significant increase in data breach incidents, with utilities and manufacturing being at the
                    forefront.
                    While the cloud is being widely being embraced, there also exist concerns regarding its safety. A
                    cloud with a poor configuration will increase vulnerability of sensitive data. Cloud security
                    therefore needs to evolve to be able to combat such threats and offer a strong defense for customers
                    that use cloud services for the benefits and efficiencies they offer. Apart from cloud security
                    vendors following good security practices, cloud services need to secure data in the cloud as well
                    as safeguard the endpoint users who leverage the service. For forecasting and disrupting attacks in
                    the real time, cybersecurity needs to transition to the cloud. Cloud can use instant analytics and
                    Big Data to manage recognized threats and foresee threats that aim to overpower security measures.
                    Cloud security needs to develop a collaborative approach, which reviews abnormal and normal activity
                    event streams for all users, to create a worldwide threat monitoring system. Predictive security in
                    the cloud has advanced the aspect of security to an extent that it will challenge cyber spies in a
                    significant manner. The technology gathers and analyzes endpoint data (unfiltered) leveraging the
                    cloud capability and makes predictions about attacks and safeguards from them.

                  <p class=" m-0">If 80% of global business leaders rate their cybersecurity strategy as excellent or good, why is it that over 85% have fallen victim to a security incident? The unspoken reality remains that hackers and cybercriminals are smart and always keep one step ahead. It is therefore important for security technologies to evolve and converge rapidly. Keeping up-to-date with emerging new trends and technologies and identifying ones that can benefit your business most is important in preventing hackers from outsmarting your best security efforts.

                 <ul>
                  <li><strong>	Optical Encryption -</strong> Originally intended to encode the visual information, the approach was later considered for digital information as raw data and QR codes. Optical encryption fundamentally relies on the double random phase encoding (DRPE) method that covers different modifications for better security and convenient implementations. Techniques built on DRPE use coherent monochrome illumination along with random phase masks to offer encrypted images holding white noise-like spectrum. While there are certain issues associated with the approach, the use of spatially-incoherent illumination has addressed related concerns. The technology is positioning itself as the next wave of change in cybersecurity. In contrast to various encryption platforms that focus on the IP layer, optical encryption implements encryption at the optical layer to ensure a significant reduction in latency while facilitating faster connection. The protective security layer associated with the approach is protocol-independent and transparent. The optical stealth encryption technology relies on fiber optics, with fiber optic cables carrying data between different locations by using the optical technology. The approach involves transmission of light at different angles in a fiber optic cable for propagation of data streams. These light elements holding the information bounce in the cable and eventually reach their destination for information delivery. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Cloud IAM -</strong> Identity and Access Management (IAM) constitutes an organization’s framework, encapsulating its technologies and policies for managing digital/ electronic identities. IAM is an automated means for allowing initiation, capture, recording as well as managing of user identities in an organization, playing a critical role in minimizing risk of external as well as internal breaches.  The most significant element in cloud security, in the context of users accessing resources, includes the mechanisms that are in place which prove the identity of users. In the current scenario, integration of this critical IAM infrastructure of organizations, onto the cloud architecture, is gaining traction. Cloud IAM solutions provide detailed access control as well visibility, which enable organizations to centrally manage their cloud resources and provide secure access to the resources, for users. Access control can be more efficiently managed with cloud IAM as it defines who has what kind of access for specific resources. Cloud-hosted IAM can be private, public or a combination of both. For companies from varied end-user industries, cloud IAM offers critical benefits including synchronization as well as provisioning of identities, federation service, single sign-on features and customer identity management among others. Enterprises are able to reduce the complexity and costs involved in managing compliance and access control, by adopting cloud for IAM. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Quantum Cryptography -</strong> The shortcomings of the public key cryptosystems have unleashed a search for alternate cryptography techniques that would prove foolproof in the face of increasing computational power of quantum computers. This had set the stage for the next breakthrough in the evolution of cryptographic technologies, namely Quantum Cryptography. Quantum cryptography presents a more practical and cost-effective approach for securing communications, with a virtually unbreakable mode of relaying information, as the technology is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, a time-tested universal scientific model, rather than complex mathematical algorithms. The data encoded in the quantum state is not possible to be replicated. Quantum cryptography ensures secured data transmission due to its ability to enable exchange of enciphering keys over private channels, resulting in complete communication security. The technology relies on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) that generates and distributes random secret keys to assist traditional communication channels in securely transmitting the data. Quantum key distribution addresses issues pertaining to security of key exchange and creates a secure key for distant parties using single photons for transmitting bits of key. Quantum cryptography harnesses the quantum-mechanical properties of light for creating secure encryption and enabling secure data transfer between any two parties. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Cloud Security Gateways -</strong> Cloud Security Gateways and/or Brokers” are defined as security policy enforcement solutions that help protect cloud based resources. Cloud security gateways/broker include a combination of multiple types of security solutions such as, single sign on, encryption, tokenization, logging, API control, key management, fine-grained access controls, advanced security intelligence data for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), among others. Cloud security gateways (CSGs), also called as CASBs, act as a gatekeeper for organizations accessing cloud resources, allowing them to extend the reach of security policies beyond their on-premise infrastructure. For instance, CSGs help in securing third-party cloud applications and services like the Dropbox, Salesforce and Google Drive through granular policy controls, content inspection, advanced threat perception and user analytics, thus safeguarding the data processed and transferred between these applications and the users’ end-points. While traditional security solutions do not have any control on how a cloud application is being used once they are approved for the user, CSGs, sitting between cloud applications and the users take cloud security a step further by providing high level of governance for application usage. They help enterprises in monitoring downloaded, uploaded, and shared information in real time. Besides enabling a retroactive analysis of cloud application usage that provides critical insights into the way applications are used, CSGs also provide comprehensive protection of data associated with the applications against variety of cyber threats without impacting their performance and usage experience of applications. CSGs helps protect and secure data outside the enterprise environment in all the three life-cycle phases when at-rest, in-transit and when in-use or being processed in memory in the cloud. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Cloud Automation in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) - </strong> Industrial Control Systems (ICS) refer to control systems that are used for monitoring industrial processes and supporting critical infrastructures that provide a wide range of essential services, including manufacturing, transport, water, and energy. ICS can comprise of just a few controllers or complex interactive and interconnected control systems. The information is received by these systems through remote sensors that monitor and measure process variables. A vast majority of the attacks on ICS computers occur through the Internet, wherein hackers search for unsecured ports to gain access to these systems. Attackers generally get network access through malicious payloads by dropping keyloggers, backdoors, and Trojans, using advanced hacking operations, such as MuddyWater, GreyEnergy, and Sharpshooter. Automation in ICS security for operational technology and critical infrastructure holds enormous potential in being a viable solution for combating cyberattacks. While companies place great emphasis on reducing cyberattack costs on critical infrastructure, operational technology, comprising several interconnected devices, are generally left unsecure</li>
                  <li><strong>	Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity -</strong> Globally, a growing number of industrial companies are making a shift towards artificial intelligence-based solutions for analyzing cybersecurity data, in line with the global trend of companies transitioning towards tools for effective and efficient automation of tasks. Through the use of AI and machine learning, tools, data related to cybersecurity can be utilized for improving overall decision making process. There is greater focus of industries to protect their critical infrastructure systems from emerging vulnerabilities and threats, which continue to grow in numbers and severity. This is hence giving rise to demand for tools, which can help companies to address the issue. AI in this regard is capable of identifying anomalous activity, which gives indication into possible attack. Sensor data is also analyzed for responding effectively to various security threats and for taking up predictive maintenance, if required. Such measures are vital for avoiding downtime in critical infrastructure, which can often lead to catastrophic results. For industrial cybersecurity, the main advantage of using AI solution is its ability to provide real time response and management. Machine algorithms are capable of detecting any abnormal exchange of data and subsequently respond to the threat. Few AI tools have the ability to monitor devices, which do not communication over TCP/IP thus leading to high visibility for non-networked equipment. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are also used increasingly for alerting wide range of changes across application and user behavior. </li>

                  <p class=" m-0">Keeping your knowledge current is one of the most important ways you can protect your company against rapidly evolving information security threats. Discussed below are few of the trending themes for 2023.</p>
                  <br />

              <ul>
                <li><strong>	IT/OT Convergence & Cybersecurity Gaps in Manufacturing Industry -</strong> In industrial assets, the growing convergence of IT and OT systems is presenting a growing threat of cybersecurity risks specifically in manufacturing companies. Given the fact that most OT systems were not designed to operate through remote or Web access, security aspects did not take into consideration various connectivity exposures. However, with OT systems and IoT devices getting increasingly connected to OT environments, industries are facing high threat of security breaches due to the fact that such devices are not embedded with strong security features. The security risk and operational threats attributed to this fact are emerging as a major challenge for the manufacturing industry. The growing adoption of IIoT in manufacturing, government and healthcare sectors is in particular posing a considerable threat to market participants due to the potential for compromise of insecure systems. The attack surface increases further with IIoT, since entire factories become connected to ensure faster and efficient operations. To deal with cybersecurity in such environments, integrating security solutions for addressing the total protection lifecycle assumes significance. </li>
                <li><strong>	Outsourcing of Cybersecurity Operations -</strong> Cybersecurity has become an important focus area for most companies. However, performing this involves several complexities and needs specialist knowledge and tools. This is leading to managed services of IT systems and cybersecurity processes being outsourced. External providers have expertise in offering solutions and services, which can identify, categorize, and address security risks, detect and react to threats, and also offer advice to enable compliance with various standards and regulations. Organizations are using third party providers for vulnerability management, security operations, awareness and training, and physical security. Given the chronic shortfall of qualified and experienced cybersecurity workforce, companies have been outsourcing all or some of their cybersecurity functions. It is considered to be an effective way to gain immediate expert assistance, while also achieving cost savings. </li>
                <li><strong>	Threat of “Shadow Cloud” & CASBs - </strong>The growing adoption of cloud storage services is resulting in increased sensitive corporate data leakage through cloud services. Also known as shadow data, the threat is escalating with growing number of companies expected to suffer losses to the tune of US$10 million a year. Shadow data occurs when employees use cloud storage and other cloud services without approval. Mobility programs being implemented across enterprises is especially aggravating the issue of shadow data. Known as Shadow BYOD, the scenario arises when employees make use of unauthorized and/or unsanctioned devices to access corporate cloud data. When unmanaged personal devices connect to corporate cloud apps, the residual data trail left behind on the device, the network, and the app posses’ significant security risks for companies. Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs), in this regard, play a vital role in minimizing these risks, while helping increase mobile productivity, by acting as a proxy for all traffic heading towards the cloud. CASBs help in continuous monitoring and filtering of traffic based on enterprise security and compliance policies and requirements. CASBs provide shadow IT discovery by enabling sanctioned application control and identifying high risk traffic (unwanted devices, users, app versions) coming from the corporate network and moving towards the cloud. CASBs provide a consolidated view of an enterprise’s cloud service usage i.e. number of people and devices accessing cloud applications (both sanctioned and sanctioned), and how information accessed is being used. </li>
                <li><strong>	Development of Quantum-Safe Certificates -</strong> Development of quantum-safe cryptography has forced the enterprises to consider the forms of quantum-safe certificates that are required to be implemented by them. Four major types of digital certificates are currently considered relevant to quantum cryptography systems, with every type adhering to X.509 digital certificate standards. These standards are the basic standards for any public-key cryptography. Each type of digital certificate is typically distinct from the other types in terms of purpose and encryption algorithm. Quantum-safe certificates are mainly referred to as the X.509 certificates that utilize encryption algorithms that are safe from quantum attacks. Although the standardization of quantum-safe encryption algorithms is still ongoing, several candidate implementations and algorithms have already been made available. Hybrid certificates are primarily referred to the cross-signed certificates that contain both conventional (ECC or RSA) signature and key, and a quantum-safe signature and key. Hybrid certificates can facilitate a migration path for the systems having multiple components that cannot be replaced or upgraded simultaneously. Composite certificates are almost similar to hybrid certificates as they also contain multiple signatures and keys. However, composite certificates utilize a combination of quantum-safe and existing algorithms, which is the major difference between them and hybrid certificates. These certificates act as a single door having multiple locks, where a person is required to have all keys for all locks of the door for opening the door.  /
                  <li><strong>	Rise of Multifactor Authentication (MFA) - </strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a user authentication model where the users will have to provide multiple pieces of information in separate authentication stages for authenticating themselves to the authenticating system. MFA basically revolves around three areas that include the knowledge factors, referred to as ‘something the user knows’ in MFA model, such as a Personal Identification Number (PIN) or passphrase; possession factors, or ‘something the user has’, such as a software certificate, physical token or access card, or passport; inherence factors, or ‘something the user is’, such as biometric traits like voice, iris or fingerprints etc. Simultaneously, MFA also incorporates ‘something the user does’ features such as user’s browsing pattern and types of device being used, and also context based attributes such as Subscriber Identity Module (SIM); source & endpoint identity characteristics; and location & time of access for use in authentication process. Frequently used combinations in MFA include one-time passwords (OTPs), which tend to be time-limited, sent to users through SMS, web portal or mobile app, and used in combination with a password or PIN; and Tokens, which produce a random number, used in combination with a password or PIN. Also growing popularity is, Authentication as a Service (AaaS), a subscription based business model where authentication is offered as a service over the Internet, eliminating the need for software licenses and on-premise hardware installation. Essentially a pay-as-you go service, AaaS offers all the benefits of a multi-tenant environment. Major benefits offered by AaaS, driving its adoption include, ability to scale authentication to multiple access points from cloud-based, on-premise applications to networks, devices and service APIs, automation of the entire authorization process, reduces upfront investments on infrastructure and resources, and maximizes effectiveness.</li>
                  <li><strong>	IoT & 5G, a Turning Point in Technology & Risks –</strong> With the adoption of 5G network technology expected to rise in the coming years, the potential risk to security from such devices will also grow for businesses and industries. IoT with 5G networks comprises a key cybersecurity trend with a global 5G network launch likely to bring a new period of inter-connectivity and technology with the Internet of Things (IoT). Also, the communication involved between various devices increases the vulnerability from attacks, outside influence, or else an unknown software bug. 5G architecture, being fairly new within the industry, requires immense research for finding and correcting loopholes so as to secure the system from any kind of external attack. 5G network could open the possibilities of various unknown network attacks. The threat levels are higher for 5G devices, since the technology can bypass certain conventional cybersecurity technologies through direct connectivity to cellular networks. 5G networks are also susceptibility to hacking attributed to man-in-the-middle attacks where the hackers hijack signals or make use of fake cell towers for stealing data in transit or for the purpose of injecting malware into connected systems. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Mobile Devices Become an Attractive Target - </strong>The increasing mobile workforce is prompting cybercriminals to shift their attention from computers and laptops towards mobile devices, most notably to smartphones. The emergence of mobile devices as an appealing target can be attributed to a number of factors such as the availability of photos, emails, messages and financial transactions. Since mobile devices are never turned off and remain in the sleep mode for a certain period, they are an easy target for attackers. Smartphones contain significant amount of professional and personal data that drive cybercriminals to explore effective strategies for entryway. As a large number of people use same password for mobile apps, hackers can conveniently move from mobile to user laptop and steal key information. There are more ways for hackers to target a mobile device in comparison to laptops as users may install malicious apps unknowingly or considering them as trusted ones. The use of public Wi-Fi also presents an opportunity for cybercriminals to target the device. Delivering malware via mobile devices is easier as users are highly likely to visit various unknown games and website through their smartphones than computers or laptops.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Identity Management Becomes Super Critical -</strong> The need to remember a large number of usernames and related passwords is making it extremely challenging for people to control individual accounts. Sheer volume of the data is compelling people to reuse passwords, write down the information or use password management solutions. Reusing passwords involves various risks as passwords stolen by hackers from one site can be conveniently used for accessing or performing malicious acts on other sites. These issues are paving way for increasing demand for centralized identity management with multi-factor authentication and OAuth to mitigate these risks. Centralized management systems help users in leveraging specific credentials for different services and sites, which reduces the need for users to memorize details. The multi-factor authentication approach thwarts hackers’ attempts to gain access to user assets as the process requires the second factor for login. These solutions are anticipated to gain broader attention owing to their ability to improve security and streamline identity management.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Zero Trust Initiatives -</strong> Gaining attention from a large number of companies, Zero Trust represents a security framework that requires authentication, authorization and continuous validation of all users for security configuration prior to accessing data and apps. The approach requires solutions and changes for managing access and pushing visibility into the environment. The consolidation of functionality into few tools enables companies to push visibility regarding access and use. The concept also holds high relevance for effective alerting and monitoring. The framework secures data and infrastructure amid the increasing level of digitalization and addresses challenges faced by organizations, such as security for remote employees, ransomware threats and hybrid clouds settings. Zero Trust is associated with specific standards, including the NIST 800-207, which represents a vendor-neutral standard for organizations and government entities. The standard ensures high level of compatibility and enhanced protection from advanced attacks for the work-from-anywhere, cloud-first model. Considering increasing incident of security breaches, the US government has made it mandatory for all federal agencies to conform to NIST 800-207 for moving towards Zero Trust. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Targeted Ransomware Will Dominate the Threat Landscape -</strong> Ransomware represents software intended to use encryption for holding data of a victim hostage to demand money. By encrypting key data of an organization or individual, the ransomware prevents users from accessing apps, databases and files, coercing organizations to pay a ransom. Capable of quickly propagating over the network to paralyze an enterprise within minutes, ransomware has emerged as one of the popular assault strategies for cybercriminals. In the recent years, various skilled cybercriminals have shifted their attention to targeted ransomware strategies for larger ransom. Targeted ransomware is increasingly used by hackers and cybercriminals for targeting major organizations across diverse industries, from education and retail through to critical infrastructure and financial services areas. The retail industry is witnessing high risk of these attacks, while the massive transition of organizations towards remote work has made the IT domain as an attractive target. Organizations in the utility and oil & gas industries are likely to face more challenges owing to their ability to pay higher ransoms. Moreover, the impact of targeted ransomware on companies in financial services industry is poised to become broader and more disastrous in the coming years.   </li>
                  <li><strong>	Acceptance of SOAR Solutions -</strong> Enterprises are expected to pay more attention to security tools and platforms with security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) capabilities such as automated detection and response. SOAR solutions assist organizations in collecting inputs that are monitored by security teams. Platforms with SOAR features can capture various indicators of compromises automatically from external sources, conduct sophisticated threat analytics and assign desired reputation scores on the basis of severity. SOAR allows users to get relevant insights into the security aspect within and outside the network by getting information from third-party sources, emerging threat feeds and endpoint security software. The information helps users in making informed decisions. The idea of SOAR focuses on automation of threat responses, feeding alerts and addressing security issues through enhanced insights with sophisticated threat analytics. The implementation of SOAR solutions allows organizations to boost security and mitigate the risk of cyber-frauds. Advanced solutions built on SOAR offer an affordable, convenient option for performing security analytics while dealing with threats for cloud resources and on-premise infrastructure.  </li>
                  <li><strong>	Threat Posed by State Actors to Grow Bigger -</strong> Sabotage and cyber-espionage often involve the role of nation-states for accessing sensitive data or undermining competing countries. In the recent years, state actors have started increasingly targeting non-governmental organizations and companies. Security agencies across countries are reporting a notable spike in number of attacks involving foreign governments on servers. As a large number of countries are set to witness government elections in 2023, the number of attacks involving state actors is poised to increase dramatically. Various countries are likely to witness cyber-attacks and hacking attempts on infrastructure to create misinformation campaigns on key social media platforms. These efforts are mainly intended to influence results and favor parties that can be beneficial for a hostile state. In addition, cyber warfare is anticipated to continue being an important component of armed conflict in the coming years.    </li>
                  <li><strong>	Stricter Regulatory Regimes -</strong> Continuous expansion of the scope of cyber-security regulations is anticipated to pave way for extensive coverage of personal data of the sizeable fraction of global population. Following broader acceptance of GDPR as the key privacy legislation, the landscape witnessed emergence of other standards, including the Personal Data Protection Act (KVKK) in Turkey, Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in California, and General Personal Data Protection Act (LGPD) in Brazil. The increasing scope of these legislations requires companies to comply with different data protection guidelines in different jurisdictions. In addition, organizations need to provide customers with information regarding the type of information collected and how it is used. These requirements indicate the need for automation of data protection and privacy management systems. In addition, an increasing number of states are anticipated to enforce legislations to regulate ransomware payments, negotiations and fines.</li>
