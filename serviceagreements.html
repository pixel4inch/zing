                    likely having an effect on Zing Services, Zing reserves the right to make changes to the dates
                    and time for all parts of Zing Services. In case of cancellation or rescheduling any Zing
                    Service for a new date and/or time, Zing may, at its sole discretion, transfer the service to be
                    valid on such a new date and/or time, or reimburse costs related to Zing Services and paid by the

                    for any refund or reimbursement. For the avoidance of doubt, Zing reserves the right to make
                    changes to Zing Services and thereto related schedules. Please note that while speakers and topics
                    may be confirmed throughout the year, circumstances beyond the control of Zing may necessitate
                    substitutions, alterations or cancellations of the speakers and/or topics. As such, Zing reserves
                    the right to change and/or modify the advertised time schedule and line up of speakers and/or topics
                    if necessary without any liability to the User whatsoever. Any substitutions or adjustments to the
                    foregoing will be updated on Zing's channels as soon as possible. </p>

                    However, the limitations set out herein shall not apply to damage caused by willful misconduct or
                    gross negligence. In order for the claim not to be forfeited, all claims for damage must be made
                    within thirty (30) days from the date that the damage was or should reasonably have been noticed by
                    the User. </p>
