                      <li> <strong>Defense Robotics to Hit Prime Time – </strong> An increasing number of nations are
                        making investments on robotic solutions on the back of growing terrorist and border encroachment
                        activities. About 90 countries have already deployed defense robots in military operations in
                        one form or the other. Defense robotics are utilized in various forms including unmanned aerial
                        vehicles (UAVs), unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). UAVs, the
                        pilot-less aircraft, constitute the most widely used form of defense robotics. The US has been a
                        pioneer in development of military UAVs, and currently holds a large fleet of UAVs supplementing
                        its military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq & Syria, and other parts of the world. Similarly,
                        UMVs are mostly made available in the form of USVs (or Unmanned Surface Vessels) and UUVs (or
                        Unmanned Underwater Vehicles) and extend superior capabilities to naval forces in maritime
                        operations. Rising emphasis on robotic solutions in command, control, communications and
                        computers (C4); intelligence, surveillance & reconnaissance (ISR); and battlefield combat
                        operations are consistently fuelling momentum in the defense robotics space. At the same time,
                        growing concerns over rising human casualties in military operations and sustained focus on
                        reducing warfield deaths through advanced strategies are creating strong business case for
                        military robotics. </li>

                        enabling precise diagnosis, assisting robots and remote treatments. Physicians can benefit from
                        robotic proactive analysis for identifying specific patterns in health graphs of patients. On
                        the other hand, machine learning-based robots are widely used in healthcare settings for
                        micro-surgeries like unclogging of blood vessels. AI robotics is transforming healthcare by
                        enabling delivery of medical services to remote areas. In addition, robotics is one of the key
                        technologies for leading companies managing large-sized warehouses for operational gains and
                        cost savings. Automated robots rely on sophisticated sensors such as haptic, auditory, visual
                        and thermal sensors for efficient warehouse operations. Haptic and thermal sensors are
                        associated with AI and improve safety through enhanced perception of the environment. These
                        sensors are critical to decision-making ability of robots, enabling seamless and safe
                        operations.</li>
