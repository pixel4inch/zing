                    4. PURPOSES AND LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
                </h2>




                <p class="mb-2">Zing processes personal data of the Users of its services for the purposes described
                    in this Privacy Policy. These processing purposes, of which one or more may apply depending on the
                    case at hand, are listed below: </p>

                <p class="mt-2 font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3">To organize Events and provide Zing Services</p>
                <p>Zing processes personal data to be able to organize Events and provide Zing Services to you under
                    the contract between you and Zing, or between the Customer Organization and Zing. We use the
                    data, for example, to handle your online registration, and payments, to enable organization of side
                    events and to provide you and the other Users with the information necessary for the proper use of
                    the Zing platform. We may also process personal data to contact you regarding the Events and
                    Zing Services as well as to inform you of any changes to the same. In the event you contact our
                    customer service, we will use the provided information to answer your questions or solve the
                    possible issues. The legitimate grounds for processing is performance of a contract. If registration
                    for an Event organized with/by a third party takes place on Zing Services (not redirecting to
                    other registration site or platform), the respective organizer and Zing are joint controllers for
                    the personal data processed for the purpose of the event registration. The legitimate ground for
                    processing is performance of a contract. With any questions related to such processing, you can
                    reach out to us.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3">To provide personalized content and customized user
                    experience</p>
                <p>If you have selected to use our Zing platform, we process personal data to generate an optimal and
                    customized user experience and to provide you with the most relevant content based on your user
                    profile. This may, for example, include providing you with customized recommendations. You may at
                    any time decide to leave Zing and remove your profile. After removing the profile Zing no longer
                    processes the user profile information for the abovementioned purposes. The legitimate grounds for
                    processing is the performance of a contract.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3">For customer communication, marketing and development</p>
                <p>We process personal data for the purposes of maintaining our customer relationships as well as for
                    marketing and advertising Zing Services and other products offered by Zing or via Zing
                    platform. This means, for example, customizing the user experience by showing targeted offers, event
                    information, and advertisements based on the information gathered from the User during his/her
                    visits to Zing Services. We process personal data also to run, maintain and develop our business
                    and to create new customer relationships. The legitimate ground for processing is the legitimate
                    interests of Zing.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3"> Electronic direct marketing</p>
                <p>In relation to electronic direct marketing, the legitimate grounds for processing personal data is
                    the legitimate interest of Zing. However, in certain cases, to be allowed to send electronic
                    direct marketing (for example, utilizing email or text messages) consent of the receiver of
                    electronic direct marketing is collected where required by applicable laws. Such consent may be
                    requested in certain parts of Zing Services, e.g. in connection with the registration. The Users
                    may withdraw given consent at any time by contacting us via email (see section 2 above for contact
                    details) or by managing consent settings via their own user account.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3"> To fulfil our legal obligations</p>
                <p>Zing processes personal data to be able to administer and fulfil its obligations under the
                    applicable laws. This includes processing data for complying with the bookkeeping obligations and
                    providing information to relevant authorities such as tax authorities. Personal data may also be
                    disclosed due to mandatory grounds arising from the applicable laws, regulations and/or, if
                    required, to the court or competent authority for legal and justified grounds. The legitimate ground
                    for processing is to comply with legal obligations.</p>


                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3"> For quality improvement, trend analysis and research</p>
                <p>We may process information about your use of Zing Services to improve the quality e.g. by analyzing
                    trends in the use of Zing Services, and to adjust, develop and improve our offering and
                    operations, including the user experience. Further, we may process the information you provide us
                    via Zing platform for research purposes (e.g. compile a publication). However, we will never
                    publish other than aggregated, non-personally identifiable data. The legitimate ground for
                    processing is the legitimate interests of Zing in maintaining and improving its services to ensure
                    their relevancy and quality. When choosing to use your data on the basis of our legitimate
                    interests, we weigh our own interests against your right to privacy. We also use pseudonymized or
                    non-personally identifiable data when possible.</p>

                    obligations under the applicable law, regulation, and/or court order; (ii) detect, prevent, or
                    otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and/or (iii) protect the interests,
                    properties or safety of Zing, the Users or the public in accordance with the applicable law. When
                    possible, we will inform the User of such data transfer and processing.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3">To authorized service providers</p>
                <p>We may share personal data to authorized service providers who perform services for us (including but
                    not limited to data storage, accounting, payment, sales and marketing service providers). Our
                    agreements with our service providers include commitments ensuring that the service providers agree
                    to limit their use of personal data and to comply with privacy and security standards at least as
                    stringent as the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3  ">With explicit consent</p>
                <p>We may share your personal data with third parties outside Zing for other reasons than the ones
                    mentioned above, when we have your explicit consent to do so. The User has the right to withdraw the
                    aforementioned consent(s) at any time.</p>




                <h2 class="mb-0">
                    6. INFORMATION SECURITY
                </h2>






                <p> We use administrative, organizational and technical measures as well as physical safeguards to
                    protect all personal data we collect and process. Measures include, for example and where necessary,
                    encryption, pseudonymization, firewalls, secure facilities and access right systems. Our security
                    controls are designed to maintain an appropriate level of data confidentiality, integrity,
                    availability, resilience and ability to restore the data. If a security breach that is likely to
                    have a negative effect to the privacy of the Users would occur despite the security measures, Zing
                    will inform the relevant Users and other affected parties, as well as relevant authorities in
                    accordance with the applicable data protection laws, as soon as possible. </p>






                <h2 class="mb-0">
                    7. STORAGE PERIOD
                </h2>



                <p>Zing does not store your personal data longer than is legally permitted and necessary for the
                    purposes of this Privacy Policy. The storage period depends on the nature of the information and on
                    the purposes of processing. The maximum storage period may therefore vary per use. Registration
                    information relating to the user account with Zing Services will be deleted after a period of five
                    (5) years from the last use of the user account in question. Zing will inform you on the oncoming
                    deletion. The data collected for specific Service or Event will be deleted or anonymized three (3)
                    years after the completion of the Service or Event. A part of the personal data relating to the user
                    account or otherwise to Zing Services may be stored in case processing is required by the
                    applicable law or is reasonably necessary for our legal obligations or legitimate interests. All
                    personal data relating to the user account with Zing Services will be anonymized or deleted after
                    a period of five (5) years from last use of the user account, with the exception of personal data
                    required in certain rare situations such as legal proceedings. We will store Technical Data of
                    unregistered Users for a reasonable time period, but in no event longer than two (2) years for the
                    purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. </p>





                <h2 class="mb-0">
                    8. USERS’ RIGHTS
                </h2>






                <p class="mt-2 font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3">Right to access </p>
                <p>The Users have the right to access the personal data relating to them and processed by us. We give
                    you the possibility to view certain data through your user account with Zing Services or request a
                    copy of your personal data.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3">Right to object</p>
                <p>If the data is processed based on our legitimate interest, you may have the right to object to
                    certain use of your personal data. If you object to the further processing of your personal data,
                    this may lead to fewer possibilities to use Zing Services.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3">Right to rectify</p>
                <p>The Users have the right to have incorrect, imprecise, incomplete, outdated or unnecessary personal
                    data we have stored about the User corrected or completed by contacting us. You can correct or
                    update some of your personal data through your user account in Zing Services.</p>

                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3">Right to erasure</p>
                <p>The Users may also request us to delete their own personal data from our systems. We will comply with
                    such requests unless we have a legitimate ground not to delete the personal data. Such legitimate
                    ground may be based on e.g. the applicable laws.</p>


                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3 ">Right to data portability</p>
                <p>In certain situations, you may have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured
                    and commonly used format and to independently transmit the data in question to a third party.

                </p>



                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1 mt-3 ">Right to withdraw consent</p>
                <p>In case the processing is based on a consent granted by the User, the User may withdraw the consent
                    at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent
                    before its withdrawal.</p>



                <p class="font-weight-bold bulitted-type mb-1">Right to restriction of processing</p>
                <p>You may request us to restrict processing of personal data, for example, when your data erasure,
                    rectification or objection requests are pending and/or when we do not have legitimate grounds to
                    process your personal data. However, this may lead to fewer possibilities to use Zing Services.
                </p>
                mt-3
                <p>The abovementioned rights may be exercised by sending an email or a letter to us on the addresses set
                    out above in section 2 (Controller's Contact Details). The message should include the following
                    information: full name, home address, email address and telephone number. We may request the
                    provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the User. We reserve the
                    right to reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, excessive or manifestly unfounded.</p>

                    9. DIRECT MARKETING
                </h2>




                <p>The User has the right to prohibit us from using User’s personal data for direct marketing purposes,
                    market research and profiling made for direct marketing purposes by contacting us on the address
                    indicated above in section 2 (Controller's Contact Details) or by using the unsubscribe function
