                  <p class=" m-0">Cleantech is moving towards large scale application and mainstream adoption. Smart technologies and software are eliminating the many previous issues concerning reliability and cost. Cleantech is seen as holding potential for major market disruption and also attractive for investors. Companies, especially startups with the most potentially disruptive innovations, are being sought by investors. Investors are placing their money in these innovations not just to speed up tech adoption cycle but for their own benefit because they offer considerable growth opportunities. The pandemic had also brought to fore the capacity of the world to adapt and adapt quickly to change and also innovate as needed. The drastically changed circumstances changed the way the world operated. Technology is being used immensely in daily lives. Even in the post-pandemic era, the human society would continue to welcome change with the same vigor and be similarly willing to adapt. This positive change in the thinking would drive more businesses, governments and also consumers to embrace clean innovations and technologies earlier in their lifecycle.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p class=" m-0">Clean technologies are touted as helping the world meet the SDG7 that call for providing access to reliable, affordable, modern and sustainable energy for all.  Cleantech can help nations move towards realizing SDG7 by accelerating off-grid solar energy uptake and deployment of cleaner cooking fuels and other clean solutions. Investments in renewable energy, especially in developing markets, have been increasing continuously, despite the many challenges. Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Costa Rica in Latin America for instance, have been witnessing increased investments in renewable energy projects. Furthermore, renewable energy is just one aspect of the cleantech movement helping the world move towards a resource-efficient, carbon-neutral and digitized future. There are several other technologies employing which, the world seeks to achieve energy access, water and air quality and long-term climate goals. Sustainable technologies for the agriculture, logistics, and transportation sectors and innovations for industrial biotechnology and manufacturing processes would also be critical aspects of future cleantech. Cleantech includes all those technologies currently being researched, for development, for realizing the goal of Net-Zero civilization, in which GHG emissions release into the atmosphere is limited to the levels of what is possible to remove or absorb. This definition of cleantech indicates that the field would be rife with opportunities for investment, entrepreneurship and also careers, in the years ahead.</p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Cleantech firms are getting their competitive advantage form smart software which is allowing the companies to operate and manage their assets, remotely. Batteries and solar panels for example, can be managed remotely, and more efficiently with the help of software. This ultimately enhances the technology’s reliability, increases sustainability and reduces cost.  High costs and low reliability have so far been the major concerns contributing towards hesitancy of renewable energy, one of the cleantechs. Smart technology holds the potential to eliminate such concerns and grant the necessary competitive edge and such advantages create opportunities for investors. The energy sector would thus be disrupted by cleantech. And, when power is provided at a lower cost and in a reliable manner, there would be increased chances of people shifting away from conventional methods and embracing clean technologies. This way, cleantech’s disruptive potential would result in at-scale adoption of technologies going forward. 

                    Government policy will also help accelerate cleantech adoption. In the U.S., the new climate plan would help speed up renewable power and other clean technology growth in the years ahead.  The infrastructure deal of President Biden is one ambitious deal worth US$73 billion for upgrading the nation’s electricity grid. Improved access for consumers, to clean energy, is one of the major aspects of the deal. Such deals, inspire confidence for investors in cleantech. The US plans to put in US$2 trillion over the coming decades, in technologies of clean energy, for achieving its goal of decarbonization. Several other countries worldwide, are similarly pushing towards achieving net-zero emission targets, and would take the help of cleantech. The market for cleantech would benefit considerably from this. Goals for reaching net-zero emissions are in place for close to 130 countries presently and these goals would drive government policies which would in turn encourage companies and consumers alike to adopt cleantech early on in their lifecycles helping it to move speedily towards mainstream use. There is therefore immense market potential for clean technology.

                    <li><strong>Rise of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) – </strong>Construction of NZEBs holds tremendous potential in
                      in overcoming climate change and global warming. NZEBs are typically constructed with significant
                      energy saving features. The cooling and heating loads are lowered through the use of
                      highly-efficient equipment, such as heat pumps, additional insulation particularly in the basement
                      and the attic, installation of high-efficiency appliances and LED lighting, and highly-efficient
                      windows, such as triple-glazed, low-emissivity windows, natural ventilation, passive shading
                      during the summer and passive solar heat gain during winter, as well as other techniques. Loads
                      for heating water can be reduced through the use of solar heating, heat recovery units on
                      wastewater, water conservation fixtures, and highly-efficient water heating equipment. Moreover,
                      daylighting with solartubes and skylights can facilitate in providing complete daytime
                      illumination within the house. Nighttime illumination is generally achieved with LED and
                      fluorescent lighting that utilize significantly lower amounts of power as compared to incandescent
                      lights, and that too without the addition of any unwanted heat. Efficiency gains made possible by
                      these technologies would allow the global buildings sector to reduce its CO2 emissions by 350 Mt,
                      by 2050. NZE buildings also necessitates occupant behavioral changes such as changing the
                      temperature setting for space heating and reducing use of hot water that is excessively heated,
                      among others. Such changes are expected to lead to reduction of around 250 Mt CO2 by 2030.
                      Increased utilization of low temperature water for washing clothes and using line drying of
                      clothes and such other changes also facilitate energy efficiency and Decarbonization. Share of
                      fossil fuels used by NZE buildings is projected to come down to 30% by 2030 and to 2% by 2050.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Living Walls & Green Roofs -</strong>Green rooftops and vertical gardens are poised to break up the
                      monotony related to traditional buildings and create a future full of green structures. These
                      green ideas are taking shape and enjoying increasing acceptance due to the pressing need to adapt
                      urban centers to unfolding risks attributed to climate change and extreme weather events that hold
                      devastating consequences for the economy, human health & wellbeing and the essential
                      infrastructure. Living walls and green roofs are capable of alleviating the impact of climate
                      change by absorbing carbon dioxide, improving the air quality and regulating temperatures. Living
                      green walls and green roofs are a unique and modern approach that incorporates nature into
                      buildings and spaces. Living walls can be effectively installed on different indoor and outdoor
                      structures for environmental benefits and appealing aesthetics. Living walls with plants are
                      capable of playing an important role in carbon sequestering. In addition, vertical gardens hold
                      potential to improve the biological diversity by supporting mini ecosystems. Living walls support
                      various beneficial organisms like bees, butterflies, humming birds and ladybugs. Living green
                      walls and green roofs improve the air quality, reduce energy consumption, act as acoustic filter
                      and improve health and wellbeing of occupants. These merits are poised to benefit living walls and
                      rooftops forests, and help them in becoming a critical part of future eco-friendly green building
                      designs in the coming years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsible Construction With Green Building Materials -</strong>Green materials are increasingly
                      integrated into construction practices, heralding a path for greener life. Recyclable steel and
                      reclaimed wood forms a major part of the green market. Currently, there is a concrete effort to
                      convert materials, for example concrete to green staples. In addition to non-toxicity,
                      bio-degradability and recyclability, maintenance and sturdiness are also key considerations. Use
                      of green building materials is increasing in both retrofitting existing buildings and new
                      construction projects. One such sustainable material include Smart Bricks, which are clay hollow
                      blocks that are resource-efficient. Installation of roof-top solar panels is also on the increase.
                      The most used material in building construction is concrete. Cement production generates close to
                      10% of the worldwide carbon emissions. Researchers and scientists therefore, have been trying to
                      produce more eco-friendly concrete and self-healing concrete has been the first step in that
                      direction. This self-healing concrete has live bacteria which remain dormant until cracks in
                      concrete are exposed to air and moisture. Once exposed to the elements, the bacterial spores
                      germinate and eat up the calcium lactate in cement and produce limestone. The limestone then fills
                      the crevices and cracks and thus allows the concrete to heal on its own. This new concrete thus
                      prevents costly maintenance job for filling up cracks and crevices and therefore can be among the
                      sustainable building materials. A few other sustainable building/construction products include
                      green roofs; cooling roofs; cement alternatives; recycled steel; natural insulation (foam, hemp
                      and wool insulation); eco-friendly flooring (recycled materials and bamboo among others); VOC-free
                      paints; air purifying paints; cabinets and countertops made of salvaged and recycled materials;
                      efficient lighting fixtures made of recycled materials and xeriscaping (using plants that require
                      very less water) among others.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Carbon Capture and Storage Will Hit the Spotlight -</strong> CCS is a critical tool for mitigating
                      climate change and the pipeline of CSS projects has grown considerably in the recent years. As of
                      2021, there were 44 nations and the EU that disclosed their targets of net-zero-emissions. There
                      is also this climate ambition alliance bringing together regions, nations, cities and also
                      investors for achieving net-zero emissions, by 2050. The alliance has over 2300 companies that
                      have pledged to achieve these emissions goals. There are presently more than 130 CCS facilities
                      worldwide. However, a network of carbon capture necessitates an expansive geological storage and
                      identifying a location that would be ideal for storage would also require huge initial investment.
                      Recently however, a trend developed in which projects started sharing CO2 transport including port
                      facilities, pipelines, storage wells and shipping, for reducing these costs. There are also
                      several new technologies deployed for removing carbon altogether. One such technology is blue
                      hydrogen. Blue hydrogen refers to the process where in fossil fuels are deployed for producing
                      clean hydrogen. There are currently, several blue hydrogen projects ongoing, providing cleaner
                      hydrogen fuel sources for helping decarbonize. Zero emission energy targets can also be achieved
                      with WtE (Waste-to-Energy) plants. Furthermore, since CCS projects would be complex there is this
                      need for strategic partnerships among different organizations. A large network of related
                      organizations can streamline projects development. Projects would also be able to better stand
                      against setbacks when they are well-funded. Heavy industries for instance, are rapidly embracing
                      the technology as a more realistic pathway towards decarbonization. In 2021 alone, there were more
                      than a hundred new facilities that were announced. A major cement producer called HeidelbergCement
                      for instance, is developing around eight initiatives for carbon capture, worldwide, while the
                      largest oil company, Aramco, had also been developing a large facility for carbon capture for
                      hydrogen production. The large steel manufacturer, ArcelorMittal, also considerably depends on
                      carbon capture. All these companies have committed themselves to achieving net zero emissions, by
                      2050. The companies are gradually moving from the pilot projects capable of capturing just 400
                      tons of carbon/day to projects that can capture more than 13 thousand </li>
                    <li><strong>Renewable Energy Storage to Witness Technology Progress -</strong> Several companies worldwide are
                      developing innovative long term storage for power generated from renewable energy sources. A
                      company called Vionx Energy, developed a vanadium-based redox flow battery. In flow batteries,
                      energy is stored in the form of electrolyte and not as electrode material. The electrolyte gets
                      dispensed from tank and is recovered in the loop, for re-energization. Longer life, quick
                      recharge, no emissions, faster response time and a flexible layout are a few benefits with flow
                      batteries. When compared to lithium ion batteries, flow batteries have higher current and power
                      density. In addition to battery chemistries for maintaining higher capacity and longer life,
                      energy storage also needs more of power electronics. Using sensors, advanced IoT analyzing
                      techniques and two way communication, the storage, charging as well as release of the energy can
                      happen in a controlled and smart fashion. There would also be several companies in the future,
                      that would offer ESaaS (Energy Storage-as-a-Service). For the world, energy storage helps reduce
                      climate change through decreasing emissions from heating & cooling activities while at the level
                      of a community, it would enable better integration of energy that is produced locally. For
                      individual users, energy storage offers improved control over energy costs. For the private
                      sector, ESS opens up newer business opportunities. The private sector can offer ESaaS and other
                      services like installation of the storage systems, virtual power plants and charging stations
                      among others. ESaaS in particular is likely to emerge as the business concept with the most
                      promise over the coming years. In an ESaaS model, energy would be made available to customers in
                      the form of a service similar to how food, films, music etc, is offered on subscriptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbon Tracking and Reporting Will Become a Must Have Carbon Footprint Management Tool –</strong> Carbon
                      tracking refers to tracking and gauging carbon emissions from various sources, both indirect and
                      direct. It enables organizations to calculate GHG emissions from their various business operations
                      and understand their footprint and also the ways to reduce it. Carbon reporting happens after
                      tracking and is relates to publishing of the data that has been gathered. It aids in creating
                      standards for reporting and helps establish transparency and facilitates comparisons among
                      enterprises. Reporting happens on a regular basis and enables in understanding an organization’s
                      progress with regards to its efforts related to environment sustainability. Proper emissions
                      reports will offer information related to overall emissions and also the activities and areas of a
                      business contributing to them. They offer analysis and insights. They also aid in creating novel
                      goals or modifying existing goals on the basis of the insights. Further, they indicate
                      opportunities for reducing emissions. Carbon accounting converts data related to carbon emissions
                      into numeric data, thereby quantifying the emissions. This aids in setting practical targets and
                      helps understands the initiatives that need to be taken to attain them. Most governments are
                      requiring some big companies to track and report their CO2 emissions. The EU needs large-scale
                      companies to publish reports on the impact of their environmental and social activities on a
                      regular basis. A good GHG accounting system should correctly measure the carbon impacts of the
                      supply chain of every company and offer insights to make the right decisions. Reporting related to
                      the progress made related to net zero targets. </li>
                    <li><strong>Vertical Farming Will Receive New Impetus -</strong> Vertical farming can aid in addressing the
                      deforestation issue. The method is also reliable and facilitates crop production all through the
                      year. In vertical farming, the requirement of water is reduced by 95% or more as aquaponic and
                      hydroponic systems are used. Also, dehumidifiers are used, which gather, recycle, and reuse the
                      water produced by plants during transpiration. It also eliminates the transportation of produce
                      over long distances, as vertical farms are generally established close to urban areas in abandoned
                      locations. This enables the delivery of food to customers in a short period in a fresher state,
                      which lowers food spoilage and wastage and helps reduce the transportation emissions and costs
                      involved. Further, in this farming approach, the problem of pests is non-existent, as plants are
                      cultivated in a closed and controlled space. This eliminates the need for pesticide and herbicide
                      usage. The need to use conservation agents is also not present, as the produce is transported over
                      short distances. The method also prevents eutrophication. And while vertical farms need energy for
                      providing artificial lighting and water and nutrients for the plants, most of the cost and
                      negative environmental impact can be offset using approaches such as thermal insulation and
                      renewable energy sources. Further, in vertical farms the risk of contamination of irrigation water
                      is low, which reduces the likelihood of disease outbreaks.</li>

                    <li><strong>Hydrogen to Become a Key Aspect of Net-Zero Strategies of Nations and Organizations -</strong> Fuel cell
                      EVs run on hydrogen and not batteries because of which, they are more efficient compared to IC
                      vehicles. They do not produce harmful emissions. Hydrogen by 2050, would power more than 400
                      million cars and up to 20 million buses. The plentiful and versatile hydrogen could offer great
                      help to nations in meeting their climate targets. It is already a component of most of the EC’s
                      net zero emission scenarios, for 2050 while in the US, there have been several DoE initiatives
                      spurring considerable investments in hydrogen economy. The capability of sustainably producing and
                      transporting hydrogen could turn it into a daily alternative energy source the world urgently
                      needs. Investments in development of hydrogen solutions are also increasingly considerably.
                      Hydrogen would also play a key role in securing energy supplies for the future and this was
                      highlighted recently with the Russia-Ukraine war. European nations are heavily dependent on
                      Russian energy and the war hastened many countries in the continent to seek means for reducing
                      this dependence. The EC released a plan for phasing out reliance on fossil fuels from Russia and
                      using renewable hydrogen instead. The proposal is for quadrupling the present targets for hydrogen
                      supplies, by 2030. Another encouraging factor for blue and green hydrogen has been the rise of ESG
                      initiatives and customers becoming keen on making the planet sustainable. From tech giants and
                      major retailers to leaders in the transportation sector, there are currently several organizations
                      pledging to cut down emissions in their supply chains and embracing hydrogen for them makes
                      perfect economic sense.</li>
                    <li><strong>Circular Waste Management Will Gain in Prominence – </strong>The world is generating around 2 billion
                      tons of solid municipal waste each year and a third of it is not managed in a manner that is
                      environmentally safer. The factors of population growth, rapid urbanization and haphazard
                      development would result in a 70 percent in global waste over the coming three decades. The East
                      APAC is currently the region generating the highest amount of waste in the world, a quarter of it
                      almost. High income countries, even though account for just 15% of the global population, are also
                      generating significant amounts of solid waste. Generation of waste increases with increase in
                      economic development. Converting waste into usable products and materials, referred to as
                      upcycling, is another popular trend currently. Companies across the world are developing and using
                      innovative means for upcycling waste into everything from fertilizers and fuel to bicycles and
                      clothes. Similar to several other industries, waste management must also proceed towards becoming
                      digitized and data-driven to make operations more efficient. The data can be used for identifying
                      fill patterns and optimizing driver schedules and routes for reducing operational costs. The cost
                      of sensors needed for collecting such data is also constantly decreasing. Smart collection bins
                      would also decrease the amount of manual labor needed. The time spent on waste management is
                      reduced. Smart methods would also result in improved sanitation and hygiene, and ultimately
                      mitigate disease vectors which breed in the open waste. Public health can thus be improved and
                      thereby quality of life enhanced. Significant amount of recycling would also be witnessed in waste
                      management in the future. Waste would be converted into energy. The future of waste management
                      would also include IoT-enabled practices, improved monitoring systems and several other
                      technology-based advancements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Steel Industry to Witness Major Decarbonizing Efforts -</strong> One major step forward for the global
                      construction industry, towards becoming green, would be through decarbonizing steel. Partial
                      decarbonization of steel can be achieved by encouraging use of the new furnace technologies that
                      are natural gas-powered. They can also use the more energy efficient direct reduced iron and HBI
                      (Hot Briquetted Iron) for making steel which lead to lesser GHG emissions than the conventional
                      BOFs (Basic Oxygen Furnaces) or coke-fueled blast furnaces. BOFs continue to account for more than
                      75% of the production of steel globally and are predominant in China and Europe. Steel CO2 can
                      also be lowered through retrofitting BOFs for CCS (Carbon Capture & Storage) and CCU (Carbon
                      Capture & Utilization). These would sequester around 85% of carbon emissions from the coke
                      feedstock. A switch can also be made to furnaces that are hydrogen-powered but the issue here
                      would be the availability of such low-carbon hydrogen. A cleaner, blue hydrogen involves combining
                      steam and fossil fuels for producing carbon dioxide and hydrogen and storing that carbon dioxide
                      underground. An even cleaner method would be to employ electrolysis for separating water and
                      hydrogen for procuring green hydrogen. Furthermore, for the construction sector striving to move
                      towards greener steel, there are significant structural and commercial barriers in addition to the
                      aforementioned technical challenges. The low margins of the sector continue to be the major
                      limiting factor. This reduces producer interest in green technologies. Conventional approaches are
                      able to produce the metal for around US$500/ metric ton, at slab level, whereas the near-zero
                      emission steel production is way more expensive. Structural steel can also be replaced with CLT
                      (Cross-Laminated Timber) and glulam beams. Such methods would also help in reducing embodied
                      carbon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cleaner Mobility Will Make it Big -</strong> EVs are an important development, which are enabling the
                      mobility sector to become cleaner. Hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid, hyperloop tech, and battery
                      vehicles are some of the electric vehicles that have been developed. Sustainable fuels are also
                      being created to make them a replacement to traditional fuels. Green hydrogen is one conventional
                      fuel that is obtained by converting water into oxygen and hydrogen with the use of low carbon
                      energy sources. Hydrogen and carbon capture technologies are likely to be instrumental in
                      decarbonizing sectors such as heavy transport, industrial, and residential. Cleaner fuel options
                      such as blue and green hydrogen, green diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel are expected to aid
                      in achieving environmental sustainability. For attaining decarbonization, AI-based green GPS
                      systems and EV charging stations, among others are also being used by the mobility industry.
                    <li><strong>Sustainable Automation Will Make Robust Investment Gains:</strong> Automation is being used in designing
                      monitoring systems that that allow autonomous systems to control appliances. Smart electricity
                      strip is a solution that stops appliances from being in the standby mode and turns them off. This
                      significantly lowers energy wastage. Sustainable automation is also being used in smart factories
                      where AI would be used for optimizing functions. Haber, an Indian company, offers an AI-based
                      solution to improve asset productivity. Data is collected by the cloud-based software of the
                      company from the sensors present in machinery. Such data is reviewed for controlling the various
                      aspects of the facility. This enables factory operators to forecast future stress. The solution
                      enables the optimization of asset performance, helps improve output, and achieve raw material
                      savings. DABBEL provides building automation technology for HVAC control systems. The Core AI
                      technology constantly models and operates buildings, which adjusts the HVAC system’s control
                      decisions. It forecasts the requirements for the future to ascertain a clean environment indoors
                      with less carbon emissions and low energy wastage. Further, the cloud-based dashboard of the
                      company facilitates easy monitoring of building processes and lessens operating expenses and
                      technical issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Usage Management Will Become a Key Focus Area -</strong> For lowering energy wastage, management
                      and optimization of energy usage is being concentrated upon. Data centers are among the high
                      energy consumers. However, infrastructural developments are reducing their energy requirements.
                      Liquid cooling and modular data centers are some of such solutions, with the former aiding in
                      preventing overheating of machines. In a similar manner, energy monitoring systems regulate the
                      environment indoors automatically to reduce energy load. Big data and AI are also being used for
                      the improvement of these systems. Jetcool is a start-up in the US that offers direct-to-chip
                      liquid cooling technology for application in data centers. The microconvective technology reduces
                      energy consumption by optimizing compute and reducing PUE (power usage effectiveness). The
                      technology is driven by thermal resistance systems (ultra-low). Further, the solutions of the
                      company lower water usage and energy expenses through the replacement of high water and
                      power-consuming systems. By comprising processors such as ASICs, GPUs, and CPUs, the technology
                      helps in lowering energy usage in big data centers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Urgency to Recycle Plastics Will Grow Stronger -</strong> Novel technologies for the management of
                      plastic waste are important for lowering carbon footprint. Sophisticated plastics recycling
                      technology can enable in upgrading various plastics. Also, these novel technologies can lower the
                      reliance on fossil fuels for the production of virgin plastics. Commercial level processes that
                      can transform unrecycled waste plastics into polymer feedstocks can eliminate the need for fossil
                      feedstocks in the production of new plastics. This can possibly augment the quantum of plastic
                      which can be recycled and significantly lower the carbon emissions which otherwise would be
                      emitted during the production of virgin plastic with the use of fossil sources. The novel process
                      can generate greater outputs of petroleum naphtha using sustainable raw materials such as animal
                      fats and used cooking oil. This can result in considerably lesser GHGs in comparison to petroleum
                      feeds.</li>
