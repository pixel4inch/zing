                <div class="card-body p-5">
                  <p class=" m-0">We live in an increasingly complex and interconnected world where
                    shaped by globalization and technological advancements diversity has become the fabric of modern
                    society. Companies eager to establish a strong presence in a variety of emerging new markets have
                    initiated the global gold rush for multicultural markets, diverse employees, and untapped consumer
                    bases. Success in global markets requires multicultural initiatives and a sustained effort to
                    integrate distinct demographic and cultural diversity into an inclusive environment that fits into
                    the broader vision of the company’s growth and advancement. This is opening up rich opportunities
                    for companies to spearhead growth by leveraging their access to a diverse talent pool. While global
                    diversity of the labor force is good and beneficial for companies to enhance creativity and drive
                    innovation, the same also challenges long held traditional business ideas and assumptions. Companies
                    are being forced to effect major structural reorganizations spanning all key areas of business
                    operations, marketing, talent recruitment and retention functions.</p>

                  <p class=" m-0">Interestingly, despite the growing levels of diversity and
                    interconnectedness, there is also growing polarization fueled by identity politics and resurgence of
                    nationalist ideals. Workplaces tend to mirror the sociocultural dynamics at play in our lives
                    outside work. At a time like the present, the importance, value and positive impact of DEI in modern
                    enterprises can no longer be debated or undermined. Even amid rapid globalization and changing
                    perceptions about diversity, ethnic minorities continue to face discrimination in the labor market
                    and as the global fight towards a fair and just society heats up, companies are feeling the urgency
                    to renew their sense of responsibility to offer DEI in the workplace. Major social and political
                    changes as evidenced by the “Black Lives Matter” protest rallies which erupted around the world,
                    means companies need to reevaluate how diverse and inclusive their workforce really is. Employers
                    now have a responsibility to protect employees from harassment and discrimination in the workplace
                    based on race, gender or color. Diversity in the business environment today goes beyond just gender,
                    race and ethnicity. It includes employees with diverse religious and political beliefs, education,
                    socioeconomic backgrounds, sexual orientation, cultures and even disabilities.</p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Even from a business standpoint, the case for diversity in workplace
                    is overwhelming given its ability to foster innovation, creativity and empathy in ways that
                    homogeneous environments can never do. As markets evolve to become more competitive than ever before
                    and the business environment gets tougher amid the crisis, companies need to remain alert, aware,
                    agile and responsive to remain afloat, profitable and successful. To be successful in a world that
                    is constantly changing, companies need to be leading the change rather than responding to it.
                    Companies with more diverse teams and inclusive are better able to lead change than those with a
                    more homogeneous workforce. A strong organizational culture and robust structural foundation are
                    critical for achieving agility that comes from internal strength. Diverse companies earn 2.5 times
                    higher cash flow per employee and inclusive teams are productive by over 35%. High-diversity
                    environments and all-inclusive culture has clear benefits and advantages. Yet, global DEI
                    initiatives are particularly challenging to successfully implement and measure. Achieving real
                    equality and inclusion is a challenging task and over 65% of employees are of the opinion that their
                    managers do not foster an inclusive environment. Achieving greater diversity in the workplace is
                    relatively easier as it represents the mix or the make-up of an entity. However, the inclusion piece
                    of the puzzle is more complex and ensuring the same is immensely tough as it involves integration of
                    the contributions, presence and perspectives of different groups of people into the environment.
                    Inclusion is all about making the mix work together as a cohesive whole by respecting, welcoming and
                    valuing the diversity of every individual’s unique background, experiences, race, ethnicity, sexual
                    orientation, gender identity, faith, tradition, and most importantly perspectives. Diversity without
                    inclusion can create a toxic culture and similarly inclusion without diversity can create an
                    uncreative and infertile environment where a company can stagnant.</p>


                    <br/>

                    <p class=" m-0">In line with the rapidly diversifying nature of the labor force, companies and their top level executives are feeling both a moral imperative and an urgent business need to pursue their diversity and inclusion strategies with an aim to deliver tangible results. There is an urgent need for better understanding people, a more nuanced understanding of individual needs. Easier said than done! “Birds of a feather flock together”. This old adage truly captures enduring human reflex to seek out others who look and sound like us. This impulse at the organizational level is the single most important and potent barrier to successful D&I outcomes. D&I training along with structured and unstructured measures is the need of the hour to educate and help people gain a broader understanding of “diversity.” Companies with high score have exhibited strong push for women in technology; have promoted cultural empathy; extended support for LGBTQ communities; have unique and diversified employees including deaf and blind; have pushed a liberal mindset; and have empowered women cross all hierarchy.</p>

                  <p class=" m-0">Despite best efforts made with the right intention, companies are unable to achieve DEI and fail to attract top talent owing to inclusivity-related issues in workplaces. Organizations are required to follow certain best practices and initiatives to make people feel safe, valuable and included in the workplace. The following are few of the actionable tactics to achieve DEI.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Building the Sense of Belonging - Employees in an organization need a sense of belonging for thriving and contributing their best to the company. The sense of belonging represents a psychological requirement that needs to be effectively met to help employees feel connected with the organization, leading to high level of creativity and engagement in workplaces. Moreover, companies can also achieve the sense of belonging by creating an inclusive culture and striving for diversity</li>
                    <li>Top-Down & Bottom-Up Approach - While the top-down approach is known to improve compliance, it fails to drive commitment. In order to achieve the desirable change, organizations are required to combine top-down and bottom up approaches. Leaders are required to define the company’s vision, seek accountability, and provide a safe working environment for people. Leadership needs to assess the diversity and inclusion policy for defining the purpose. On the other hand, employees must share individual perspectives through dialogue, get connected and contribute to D&I initiatives for creating the desirable culture. From leaders through to frontline workers, all individuals are required to understand their respective roles in the organizational culture and D&I initiatives.</li>
<li>	Minimizing Fear - Workplace settings that challenge people’s beliefs make them respond with distrust and fear. While fear is perceived as a strong motivator and productivity enhancer, it leads to narrow perspectives and hinder efforts to make workplaces inclusive. By connecting people through storytelling and shared experiences, organizations can move towards desirable positive changes. In addition to identifying areas for improvement, employers need to spotlight success as well as cerebrate it. These approaches help companies in reducing fear and driving worker commitment to desired diversity and inclusion.</li>
                
<li>	Helping Employees Contribute Full Potential - Like the society, the organizational culture is also optimized for training and rewarding people who are fit and align with its specific goal. However, the exclusive focus on a specific set of employees promotes exclusion rather than inclusion. Unfair benefits and salaries to people from specific backgrounds led to unhealthy culture and affect diversity. Organizations need to strive for a culture that helps people in contributing their full potential. The approach requires re-imagination of the corporate culture and beliefs as well as efforts to ensure fairness for workers to make them feel valued and accepted. In addition, equal and fair career advancement and growth opportunities allow organizations to attract and retain the talent.</li>
<li>	Going Beyond Traditional Hiring Process - While the hiring process helps companies achieve diversity numbers, it doesn’t guarantee the inclusive culture and the worker experience goes beyond the offer letter. In order to nurture and retain the talent, companies need to focus on end-to-end worker experience and create conditions to promote inclusion. As D&I initiatives go beyond the hiring process and cover diverse aspects in routine operations, organizations need to adapt the entire process for scaling inclusive and diverse behaviors. The focus of traditional hiring process on academic background and the job experience hinders diversity. The integration of reliable and valid personality assessments is an effective option to measure motivations, personality traits and skills of a candidate. Companies considering personality tests for the hiring process are more likely to achieve diverse workforces.</li>
<li>	Inclusive Leadership -The continuous shift of organizations towards diversity and inclusion is creating the need for leaders who can identify exclusionary behaviors and practices for prompt actions. Inclusive leadership represents a crucial skill for organizations that are coordinating diverse teams and enabling employees to achieve peak performance. Inclusive leaders touch different aspects of the diversity and inclusion policy to help companies in attaining their objectives. These leaders set standards and norms for business practices as well as create environments that encourage people to contribute to their full potential. Inclusive leadership optimizes unique and individual views, perspectives and experiences for benefitting all stakeholders.</li>
<li>	Inclusion Should be a Continuous Process - Inclusion is not limited to a typical training session and represents an ongoing process, requiring people to identify moments that can be used for building new habits depicting inclusion. Putting these habits into action along with providing a supportive environment for healthy conversations can allow companies to achieve real change. Using employees as cohorts for prompting and driving inclusion is a more effective approach in comparison to conventional training sessions. In addition, companies need to encourage inclusive language that addresses both male and female employees to help them feel included and connected. Organizations are also required to focus on regular feedback for listening to employees and their concerns for desirable actions.</li>

                  <p class=" m-0">How things would play out in 2023 and beyond will be largely driven by certain key trends in the area of corporate diversity, in addition to the actions that leaders would take around these trends.</p>
                  <br/>
                  
                  <ul>

<li>	Managing the Evolving Remote Workforce - Even as the pandemic recedes to the endemic stage and businesses are resuming operations with office space open as usual, the remote work model is continuing to co-exist with the in-office set-up. With a certain number employees in the workforce still working remotely, businesses face an uphill task. Considering each of the WFH employee works under a different living condition, the challenges are unique with no single solution. As in case of women employees, they need to balance work and home, and might lack a dedicated space for work from where they can focus on work alone. Businesses need to brainstorm means to bridge such gaps and overcome challenges of this distributed model.</li>
<li>	Managing the Multigenerational Workforce - The current businesses work with a workforce that is the most diverse of all times. The characteristic feature of this workforce is the co-existence of employees that belong to five different generations. In companies working with all these five generations of people, a typical workforce mix would comprise the silent generation (people born between 1928 and 1945), the baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964), the generation X (born between 1965 and 1980), the generation Y or millennials (born between 1981 and 96) and the newest of all generation Z (from 1997 and continuing). Individually, people from each of these generations have unique expectations from their work lives, and bring with them different voices, skills and life experiences to their workplace that ultimately shapes a company’s work culture. Such a diverse workforce spanning five generations requires employers, business leaders and human resource managers to be well acquainted with the capabilities and characteristics of each of the generation, and have well framed strategies to make employees of all generations feel inclusive and celebrated for who they are.</li>
<li>	Purging Unconscious Bias at Workplaces - Unconscious bias, the tendency to form opinions, process information and arrive at decisions on the basis of inherent or unconscious prejudices and biases towards certain groups of people or individuals, impacts the type of relationship an employer or business leader develops with each of its employee. Since this relationship influences the decisions that are made at workplaces, where a truly inclusive workforce comprises of people with varied ethnicity, backgrounds and experiences, it is important that businesses and their leaders have strategies in place that ensure such biases and prejudices are purged or controlled regularly.</li>
<li>	Embracing Diverse Gender Identity & Expression - The recent years have seen awareness increase about the diverse gender identities and various gender expressions. As organizations the world have on their payroll people with such diverse gender identities, they need to adopt inclusive practices that may include providing gender-neutral restrooms, employee health benefits that support transitioning individuals, and creating a mindful atmosphere where use of inclusive language is encouraged to communicate with transgender or non-binary employees, among others.</li>
<li>	Preparing for Systemic Change - Over the previous couple of years, there has been a rise in instances of systemic injustices reflective of the flaws that exist globally on institutional level. Appalling crimes against innocent people of color have brought to fore the unjust and racist nature of society that continues to exists even in the most developed nations. Businesses need to incorporate some critical systemic changes that would positively influence both the workplaces and societies at large. They can ensure racial discrimination is kept at bay by introducing policies that stress on safety of people of all races and create positive experiences at workplaces</li>
<li>	Improved Transparency in Goal - A business with a diverse workforce need not imply a higher level of inclusion and equity. Even when organizations step up efforts to increase their diversity, the same might not translate into greater efforts at inclusivity. In order to become a truly diverse and inclusive organization, businesses would need to set transparent goals and targets and introduce relevant D&I initiatives. These measures would make those leading the organization more accountable, promote honest interactions between employees and their superiors, and foster an environment where employees feel encouraged to share their viewpoint, solutions and/or ideas.</li>
<li>	The Time to Hire Diversity Professionals Has Come - With workplaces becoming more diverse, companies might require professional help. Diversity professionals are one of the newest categories of experts that organizations are hiring to address their D&I requirements. Diversity professionals come with the vision and mission to create a diverse and inclusive workplace, and handle multiple roles involving human resource and recruitment, as well as leadership responsibilities. They might need to multitask to organize and conduct D&I related educational sessions, introduce novel ideas for improved D&I atmosphere at a workplace, create an inclusive workplace culture, encourage all to use inclusive language, manage workplace discrimination or harassment related complaints, among others. The need for and role of diversity professionals is only expected to grow in the coming years.</li>
<li>	Supporting Mental Health of Employees - Supporting mental health of employees has emerged as a priority for most organizations in order to ensure that their diverse talent pool continues to perform efficiently for optimal operational performance of a business. Businesses are aware of the toll the global pandemic and its repercussions have taken on the mental wellbeing of employees, and the difficulties their employees are facing in adjusting to the new normal. While some lost their jobs as businesses closed down, others had to adjust to the new work-from-home model, all while living in the fear of contracting coronavirus, which created a stressful environment for most people. By creating a supportive environment, businesses can ensure that metal health of their employees does not get compromised. They may achieve this through simpler means such as by encouraging managers, supervisors and peers to converse and empathize with each other.</li>
<li>	Avoiding Gestures of Tokenism - Prioritizing diversity and inclusion means much more that simply hiring a woman in a boardroom or team full of men, or making way for one people of color in the workplace. Such a move could simply reflect an attitude of tokenism. Organizations need to be mindful in their approach towards D&I, and incorporate strategies and policies that truly promote diversity and inclusion.</li>
