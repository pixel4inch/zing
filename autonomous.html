Players across the automotive value chain are investing in new technologies for their ability to drive growth and ROI. These technologies are transformative in characteristics with potential to create massive economic value in terms of reduced costs, increased profits and creation of new market opportunities. These technologies provide an incentive and opportunity for change and innovation to create new market opportunities. The need to adapt to an always changing market environment is the new reality that confronts both businesses and consumers worldwide, thus leading to the adoption of new technologies. The coming years are forecast to witness a sharp increase in venture capital investments in disruptive technology stocks.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p class=" m-0">In recent years, connectivity has emerged as an indispensable feature in the automotive industry. As “Internet of Things” becomes a key part of the modern automotive digital infrastructure, the era of connected cars is ready to speed down the information highway. The impact of connected cars will be felt in the three broad areas of In-Vehicle Communication, Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication, and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communication. Connectivity, in this regard, will be deployed through Infotainment, Navigation and Telematics. The growing interest in connected cars is strongly supported by effervescent developments in automotive electronics, specifically the evolution of five important enabling technologies i.e. in-car Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC), Integrated GNSS, and Automotive Ethernet. These technologies play vital roles in vehicle connectivity, paring, and communication. Right from enabling the development of intelligent cars that can communicate wirelessly to fully autonomous self-driven cars, connectivity solutions and technologies are revolutionizing the automotive industry.</p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">The race to develop the ultimate fully autonomous vehicles has already begun, and self-driving cars, straight out of the sci-fi movies would soon drive on real roads. Big wigs, including Tesla and Google have been spearheading automobile technology advancements and investing heavily to bring the best of comfort, safety and connectivity to everyday automobile commuter. Tesla is working with camera sensors and Google with radar-like technologies that use light instead of radio waves. Their individual integration with AI and 5G connectivity would be game-changer in the automobile space. Nevertheless, another disruptive technology is already here in the form of electric vehicles, the environmental saviours with ability to cut down global annual carbon footprint by as much as 0.8 gigatons, equivalent to that of emissions released by Germany alone. A much brighter side of EVs is that most would be using batteries charged with renewable energy, which would make for more fuel-efficient rides. With almost all major automobile makers announcing phased discontinuation of their conventional gasoline engine models and switching to EV production, the share of EVs in the total automobiles mix would exceed the internal combustion engine models.</p>


                  <br />



                  <p class="m-0">Major trends in the autonomous vehicles industry going forward would reflect the increased focus of automakers on enhancing driver safety and making their manufacturing more sustainable. There are currently, quite a few startups in the industry integrating AVs with advanced technologies like LiDAR, computer vision, and ADAS among others in new and innovative ways. Neural networks and deep learning algorithms are being used for improving control actions and decision making during driving. Braking and steering among other critical functions in these vehicles would now be controlled by these technologies. Increased focus is also upon improving communication between autonomous cars and other infrastructure on the road. Growing prominence of IoT and XR among other technologies constitutes another prominent AV industry trend currently. 
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p> IoT would be the most prominent of all new technologies to make its way into automotive manufacture. IoT connects AVs to the Internet, other vehicles, real-time traffic conditions, and other infrastructure in the surroundings. AVs become capable of acquiring data in the real time and using it to make decisions on-the-go based on dynamic traffic conditions, for preventing accidents. With IoT-enabled sensors, vehicles would be able to monitor surroundings and identify oncoming obstacles. LiDAR is a new sensor technology that makes use of lasers for scanning the surrounding environment. LiDAR sensors use laser pulses which work through continuous rotation and help create 3D representations of the surroundings. AVs use this precise information and quickly react to avoid obstacles. AutoL, a startup from South Korea, developed LiDAR sensors for Level-III and above autonomous driving. The sensors are integrated with high sensitivity transmission as well as reception features. They identify surroundings in great detail allowing a more precise detection. Objects up to 300 mts could be detected, during daytime, offering drivers a wider and longer-range vision field for quickly detecting pedestrians, other vehicles, traffic and other infrastructure. Another startup from the US, Omnitron Sensors, had been working on developing MEMS sensing technology for AVs by combining laser scanning with new silicon photonics. The company is trying to create optical MEMS sensors that can transmit pulses of light for capturing reflections and detecting objects. Autonomy and safety of self-driving vehicles could be increased considerably with such a sensing technology. </p>

                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">Increased use of AI for AVs would emerge as another key trend over the coming years. Already, AI algorithms can be seen advancing quite a few AV applications. Algorithms for object detection for instance, are able to determine vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs and other obstacles with greater accuracy. CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are able to identify and categorize various aspects of the road allowing AVs to make better path planning and route optimization decisions. Deep learning algorithm innovations are enabling improved voice and gesture recognition, motion detection and sentiment analysis for AVs. The algorithms are also facilitating natural language and in-car infotainment interfaces. Head and eye movements are effectively tracked with ML algorithms. These algorithms also help in monitoring facial expressions and behaviour of driver for improving safety of driving. There are quite a few startups working towards developing AI solutions for AVs. dRISK for instance, is a startup in UK that has been making tools for AV training. The company uses AI and data sets including object and semantic segmentation data, videos, training images and depth maps among others, for training AVs. The company aids driverless cars quickly detect and respond to higher risk edge circumstances for enhancing both safety and ability of the vehicles. Another startup, Arctictern, from Germany, has been offering an AI-based DMS (Driver Monitoring Systems) DL algorithms of which, continuously monitor and analyze the head, face and eye movements of the driver and also assess the body temperature and heart rate for detecting distraction, drowsiness and wellness. In the case of an imminent accident, the algorithms warn the driver with sound or flashlights and may also assume control of the vehicle for safeguarding it as well as the passengers from collisions.</p>

                  <br/>
                  <p class="m-0">Increased reliance of AVs on big data would emerge as another prominent trend in the coming years. AVs would come to depend heavily on information received through the radar, sensors and cameras and such an increase in big data would extend use cases for DL algorithms in AVs for making their operation safer. Analysis of the data from in-built sensors in the vehicle is also necessary for mapping surroundings. Manufacturers of AVs are also using data from vehicles for improving vehicle designing and manufacture.</p>

                  <p class=" m-0">The automotive industry is the most dynamic and active sector with technology
                    developments taking place at rapid speeds. Identifying emerging technology trends is therefore very
                    important to know what to expect and be prepared for the future. Below we examine several technology
                    dynamics affecting growth over the next couple of years.</p>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Big Data -</strong> Increased reliance of AVs on big data would emerge as another prominent trend in the
                      coming years. AVs would come to depend heavily on information received through the radar, sensors
                      and cameras and such an increase in big data would extend use cases for DL algorithms in AVs for
                      making their operation safer. Analysis of the data from in-built sensors in the vehicle is also
                      necessary for mapping surroundings. Manufacturers of AVs are also using data from vehicles for
                      improving vehicle designing and manufacture. Among the notable startups working in this segment is
                      Kognic, the Swedish company, working on a perception analytics platform which can make AV
                      operation safer through measurement of KPIs for judging automotive data quality. The platform also
                      enables manufacturers develop safer perception systems for improving vehicular safety. Aidrivers,
                      a UK-based startup, had also been working on creating an autonomous information platform that
                      leverages knowledge-based path planning for optimizing and managing fleets. Using 3D mapping,
                      localization and continuous information gathering, the platform can enhance perception as well as
                      responsiveness of AVs thus increasing their autonomy. The company also provides a platform that
                      creates an AV environment’s 3D simulation for facilitating testing and staging with minimal
                      downtime. </li>
                    <li><strong>Cybersecurity -</strong> Cybersecurity advancements are also increasing in number as AVs witness
                      increased mainstream use. As more devices and systems are integrated in vehicles, new
                      vulnerabilities and threats emerge. Cyber attacks on AVs lead to loss of control of the vehicle,
                      collisions, system failures, data thefts and other issues. Startups therefore are working towards
                      developing cybersecurity solutions, specifically for addressing these challenges confronting AVs.
                      Solutions are especially being developed for process auditing, risk analysis and security
                      assessments. These solutions ensure reliable communication between the driver and the vehicle and
                      between vehicles and infrastructure for enhanced safety and flow of traffic. Saesol Tech is a
                      startup from South Korea developing V2X cybersecurity for AV driving. The solution leverages VPNs
                      (Virtual Private Networks) and security authentication servers for protecting self-driving
                      vehicles from cyber-attacks. Another startup working on vehicle safety verification technologies
                      is Foretellix, an Israeli company. The company provides digital vehicular safety verification
                      tools for AVs. Foretify is the company’s platform that employs big data analytics for testing
                      automation of AVs and validating their security and productivity. It can detect bugs early on in
                      the vehicle development cycle thus reducing chances of failure of its autonomous systems. It also
                      enables complete traceability for the integrated systems, for improved security of the vehicles.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong> AR/VR Technologies -</strong> AR/VR technologies would also come to play significant roles in driving
                      mainstream use of AVs. Realistic, virtual scenarios encountered by vehicles are generated by VR
                      for creating a safe environment for AV software testing. AR on the other hand powers HUDs which
                      provide better entertainment and navigation options for drivers and also help them better
                      understand surrounding environment. There are currently, several startups working on creating
                      virtual automotive showrooms for offering unique experiences. VisualARisse is a US based startup
                      providing an AR-based, holographic 4D imaging technology for AVs. Using Radar, LiDAR and cameras,
                      navigation data, safety alerts and virtual road signs are displayed by the system, for drivers,
                      warning them of obstacles beyond their line-of-sight. The system can thus enhance safety of AVs,
                      despite poor lighting and weather conditions. Another US-based startup, called CY Vision, had been
                      developing 3D holographic HUDs that make use of AR for scanning multiple depth planes for
                      providing a larger FoV (Field-of-View) for drivers. The system developed by the company uses
                      cameras, advanced driver assist, LiDAR, smartphones and GPS for creating most engaging visual
                      experiences for drivers. The higher frame rate overlays adapt to driver’s head and eye position,
                      dynamically, reducing off-road time, thus preventing distractions during driving. </li>
                    <li><strong> Blockchain -</strong> Blockchain adoption for self-driving vehicles would also increase in the years
                      ahead. The vehicles need processing power for processing large data volumes and the technology of
                      blockchain with its cryptography and distributed ledger attributes, allows for a faster and secure
                      management of such huge loads of data. The network of decentralized ledger enables access to all
                      of the data, simultaneously and accurately, for better communication, connectivity and tracking of
                      vehicles. Smart contracts enabled by blockchain additionally simplify several other aspects
                      including insurance payments, toll payments and payments for repairs for AVs. Blockchain can also
                      facilitate incentivization for data sharing through V2I and V2V. Blockchain-based solutions allow
                      vehicle owners earn through selling vehicle data to other parties, including manufacturers.
                      Mobilian is a UAE-based company, a startup, providing blockchain-based network for securing AVs.
                      The solution collects and stores unstructured data pertaining to AVs while the blockchain ensures
                      accuracy of such gathered data which finds onward use in AI solutions development for AVs for
                      preventing cyberattacks and for making autonomous operations more secure. Autonomy Chain is a
                      Singaporean startup, also offering blockchain based solutions. The company’s cloud network for
                      driver-less cars is blockchain based and connects the vehicles to a platform where transparent and
                      safe information exchange is possible. Drivers of AVs would be benefitted from such shared data.
                      The platform is thus capable of democratizing vehicular data exchange. </li>
                    <li><strong> V2X -</strong> A key technology as important as sensors in enabling autonomous driving is
                      “communication”. A smart connected, autonomous car in order to be safe must be capable of
                      communicating with other vehicles, pedestrians, devices, infrastructure, grid, and smart homes.
                      And this brings Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) into the spotlight. Mobilizing the comprehensive
                      ecosystem of stakeholders is key to revolutionizing the mobility ecosystem and drive growth in the
                      V2X market. With the V2X market evolving and bringing together an entire ecosystem of vital
                      players comprising auto OEMs, mobile network operators (MNOs), cloud service providers, tier-1
                      suppliers, cartography and map providers, road operators, telecom suppliers and traffic
                      infrastructure providers, the path to commercialization is becoming increasingly clear. Emerging
                      signs of collaboration among global players in this ecosystem is a harbinger of good news and a
                      brighter outlook for the V2X market. This is because before autonomous cars can become a reality,
                      communication and data analytics need to evolve to overcome safety issues of a driverless future.
                      This problem cannot however be solved by integrating more sensors in a car. This ecosystem of
                      players therefore acquires new importance and significance as stakeholders who will shape the
                      commercialization and adoption of V2X in the coming years. The role of these stakeholders in the
                      future will become important and crucial as adoption of V2X increases. Auto OEMs are already
                      partnering with MNOs to provide vehicle information, driving characteristics, driver behaviour
                      analysis, location information, and OTA updates. Vehicle specific information, for instance, can
                      be broadcasted by MNOs within and beyond the direct V2V communication range. Also known as
                      WLAN-based V2X, DSRC uses radio communication provided by 802.11p. There are strong and clearly
                      visible signs of C-V2X gaining momentum globally with the latest in the string of developments
                      being the integration of C-V2X into Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ Automotive 4G/5G platforms. 5G based
                      C-V2X has also arrived as a powerful unified connectivity fabric to expand applications and
                      performance. </li>
                    <li><strong> Predictive Capabilities -</strong> Predictive capabilities built upon artificial intelligence and
                      machine learning technologies are delivering a never seen before personalized driving experience.
                      Automobiles are built around algorithms that enable owners to select application preferences such
                      as for their in-car infotainment system. These vehicles can easily be connected to smartphones,
                      take voice commands and change user interface. At the same time, sensor data trigger alerts for
                      any upcoming service or maintenance requirement. This way predictive analysis not just benefits
                      the automobile owners but also the automakers, as they gain prior knowledge of the functioning of
                      parts while they are still in warranty period. In the event of any malfunction or defect, the
                      automakers can replace the particular part even before the customer sends request, building
                      reputation and goodwill for their after-sales service in the market. </li>
                    <li><strong>Telematics -</strong> Telematics is another advanced automobile functionality bought alive by in-vehicle
                      Wi-Fi powered by 4G LTE that enables long-distance transmission of computerized data. Vehicle
                      owners can remain assured of their vehicle security and safety as they monitor their automobiles,
                      even remotely, using smartphone-enabled dashboards for advanced telematics. External cameras and
                      sensors track the condition of an automobile and transmit data to an owner’s smartphone,
                      triggering real-time alters in case of forced intrusion by any stranger. As a plus, the IoT
                      technology enables the connected automobile to place a call to concerned authorities in emergency
                      situations.</li>

                  <p class=" m-0">The automotive industry is the most dynamic and active sector with technology
                    developments taking place at rapid speeds. Identifying emerging technology trends is therefore very
                    important to know what to expect and be prepared for the future. Below we examine several technology
                    dynamics affecting growth over the next couple of years.</p>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong> Trucks Will See Huge Progress Towards Commercial Deployment -</strong> Market conditions are
                      currently right for autonomous trucks to prosper. In countries like the US for instance, the issue
                      of driver shortages makes for a strong case for autonomous trucks. Similar driver problems exist
                      in the Chinese and European markets. Driver population in these countries has been aging, with no
                      commensurate replacement pipeline. This combined with the massive eCommerce growth creates a
                      perfect business case for autonomous trucks. The first autonomous truck deployments would also
                      likely be for transportation of goods between states, on the vast interstate stretches. This would
                      likely eliminate for trucks the challenging scenarios typically faced by autonomous vehicles meant
                      for cities. There would be fewer stop signs, pedestrians, turns, curves and such other situations
                      that necessitate human judgement. Autonomous trucks also bring in considerable productivity
                      enhancements. In the US for instance, several journeys take many days to complete, especially
                      because of the limits on driving times for human drivers. Autonomous trucks would be exempt from
                      such rules and therefore can potentially reduce delivery time by half, for journeys over same
                      distances.</li>
                    <li><strong>4D Imaging Sensors from Startups to Make it Big -</strong> Consumer vehicles today are being shipped
                      integrated with the next-generation 4D imaging radars that bring in considerably higher
                      performance enhancements when compared to previous generation radars. Some of the new 4D imaging
                      radars feature sixteen times higher resolution. Tier-I suppliers are achieving this by employing
                      four radar chips instead of one, usually found in existing models. It would offer consumers more
                      effective and smoother ADAS features for offering improved experience and safer functionalities
                      such as automatic emergency brake systems. Some of the vehicles fitted with these new imaging
                      radars are the Feifan R7 in China that uses the ZF model and BMX iX which employs Continental’s
                      ARS540. There have also been a few startups trying to develop their own versions of
                      next-generation radars with even more compelling tech. Examples include Uhnder, the Texas based
                      company and Arbe, the Israeli company. The established tier-one suppliers are using silicon CMOS
                      technologies, with 40 to 45 nm transistor sizing but these startups are using 28 nm and 22 nm
                      process, respectively. The smaller sizes of transistors provide them with greater imaging
                      potential offered on a smaller chip. Uhnder is able to get similar resolution, with a single chip
                      which ZF and Continent are able to achieve using four. Arbe additionally is able to bring in ten
                      times higher resolution than Uhnder, ZF and Continental. Such performance gains achieved by these
                      startups are compelling but the companies are still required to ensure viable routes for
                      manufacture and deployment. The companies however, appear to have been successful so far. Arbe
                      made an announcement in the month of October, 2022, of its partnership with Veoneer, a company
                      trying to develop radars with the reference design provided by Arbe. Pre-production versions of
                      the 2K 4D imaging radars are expected to become ready by the mid of 2023. Uhnder on the other
                      hand, could arrive even sooner as the company’s radar chip is all set to be launched by Magna, a
                      tier-one-supplier, as Icon. Fisker Ocean SUVs would be integrated with Icon 4D imaging sensors.

                    <li><strong>LiDAR to Emerge as the Game Changing Technology -</strong> While 4D imaging radars enable high
                      performance autonomous features for vehicles, there is another technology that can emerge as a
                      game changer in the AV industry over the coming years and this is called the technology of LiDAR.
                      For long, this technology had been cost-prohibitive but had ultimately reached the point where
                      automotive OEMs are looking at integrating it liberally in their new vehicle models, especially
                      the premium models. There have been several announcements for LiDAR integration in 2023. LiDAR is
                      as old as the radar technology. The initial versions were the simple products used by defense and
                      aerospace sectors mainly for ranging applications. Over the years, applications expanded as
                      LiDAR’s ability to measure velocity and angles and produce 3D maps improved. However, the
                      equipment continued to be costly. It was only in the 2000s that the advantages with LiDAR for the
                      automotive industry became clearer. LiDAR was recognized as offering radar capabilities at much
                      greater resolutions. While for long, the technology was expensive, prohibiting its widespread use
                      in the automotive manufacturing, the year 2021 was the turning point, when an increased number of
                      auto makers announced their new models integrated with LiDAR. Volvo would use Luminar while BMW
                      had selected Innoviz. Denzo and Continental would be shipping on Lexus and Toyotas. These are
                      however, the premium vehicle examples but over the coming five to ten years, several lower-priced
                      vehicle models would also be integrated with LiDAR, especially because of the safety benefits the
                      technology offers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Greater Media Coverage on Robotaxis & Roboshuttles -</strong> One of the prominent trends in the global
                      AV industry is the commercial autonomous taxi services coming online across several places.
                      Robotaxis for instance, were started in San Francisco by the market leader, Cruise. . Cruise’s
                      fleet has been operating just 30 vehicles, out of its 150 vehicles-strong fleet for which the
                      company secured permission. Limited speed of the vehicle had been another issue. Speed is limited
                      to 30 mph and the service is allowed to remain operational only during night time, during 10 PM-6
                      AM. Also, they are allowed to cover just a small portion of the city. Robotaxis therefore, have
                      not yet caused the major transportation revolution they were intended to cause. However, these can
                      be considered the initial right steps, towards complete autonomous driving. Furthermore, Waymo,
                      which had been a frontrunner in the AV race, similar to cruise, appears to have fallen behind
                      Cruise, as its leadership in miles/disengagement slipped off in the ranking recently, to seventh.
                      Miles/disengagement is a measure of number of miles companies complete in one year against the
                      number of times it necessitates intervention of safety driver for taking control back from the
                      autonomous system. Waymo’s low performance is being attributed to its strategy of initially
                      testing the vehicles on suburban environments which are less challenging than the environment in
                      San Francisco. Cruise on the other hand, started off with limited service within San Francisco
                      where the traffic is more challenging. However, currently, Waymo has been targeting development in
                      the city of Los Angeles, with more robotaxi-friendly network of roads compared to San Francisco.
                      Elsewhere in the world, China can be seen ramping up deployments of autonomous taxis. Autonomous
                      robotaxis by Baidu, AutoX and Pony.ai for instance, would be widespread over the coming years.
                      Pony.ai and Baidu conduct tests in Beijing and therefore have limited services for commercial
                      robotaxis, similar to Waymo and Cruise.</li>
