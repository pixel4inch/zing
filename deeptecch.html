                  <p class=" m-0">A significant portion of conversations around startups and entrepreneurship is focused
                    on DeepTech. This investment ecosystem is in the news for both its immense potential to generate
                    higher revenues & ROI and for its need for higher seed and early stage funding. Currently, only a
                    small percentage of technology funds reach this ecosystem. In India, the figure stands at 11.8%. So
                    why is the DeepTech startup ecosystem different from the mainstream technology startup ecosystem?
                    Primarily because their lifecycles and risk profiles are different. DeepTech startups have longer
                    gestation periods, are R&D intensive, capital intensive and are riskier with higher possibilities of
                    failure. Nevertheless, these startups have the potential to transform industries, societies and
                    economies, which is a very important attribute given the backdrop of several urgent and pressing
                    issues facing the world today. Startups that are successful have the potential to earn exponential
                    profits. DeepTech startups use cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI),
                    robotics, quantum, blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), drones and augmented reality (AR) to build
                    products and solutions that overthrow current challenges and disrupt the market. The strength of
                    DeepTech can be highlighted by the last generation of new platform technologies such as PCs, silicon
                    chips, the Internet and mobile technologies, and reflects the potential it has for solving or
                    minimizing some of the major world problems such as climate change, global warming, disease
                    prevention and treatment, enough food for the growing world population and addressing the needs of
                    an aging population.</p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">DeepTech startups are established with a vision to solve seemingly intractable
                    societal or environmental challenges. It is therefore of little surprise why the investment fever in
                    Silicon Valley and other major investment hubs like Shanghai in China is moving towards DeepTech.
                    Truly inventive DeepTech startups will see impressive growth and global investments in this space
                    will quadruple in the coming years. While mainstream tech investments are sensitive to economic
                    climate, DeepTech once established will remain resilient as solutions to pressing issues are always
                    in demand, even more so in a weak economic climate fraught with challenges. A fine example of
                    DeepTech innovation is a startup that can apply AI to forecast natural disasters or use molecular
                    imaging technologies to identify a disease or its predisposition that is beyond the capability of
                    available diagnostic testing methods. Addressing a challenge is the starting point from where
                    DeepTech startups can make a disruptive beginning. So what and where are the current challenges we
                    face today? </p>

                  <p class=" m-0">The Indian DeepTech space is entering an interesting phase given the rapid pace of industrialization, infrastructure development and the internet economy threatened by the disruptive changes anticipated in the wake of climate change and rise of metaverse. The domestic DeepTech ecosystem has garnered a massive 55% growth in the previous decade and runs parallel to the well-developed European, Chinese, Israeli and the US markets. The bright minds at work in start-ups and university labs have contributed immensely to the growth of the Indian DeepTech start-up ecosystem, forcing the country to make commendable inroads in areas including clean energy, cold chain management, drone delivery and climate action. The Indian DeepTech innovation has truly generated dynamic sustainability solutions with remarkable outcomes. The country currently can boast of making headway in CRM, mobile and cloud tools deployment across various industries for unparalleled connectivity, computing power and storage solutions. However, not being the end-of-road but rather the beginning of a new era, India needs more DeepTech start-ups for further digitalization. </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">Furthering the DeepTech journey would require India to find more capital for investment, as the greater the access to funding the most remarkable the results. Interestingly, the investment environment is positive, as Indian investors are more than willing to take risk, defy perceptions and prove new theories. India also needs stronger policy making, and the Indian Government is just fulfilling the gap with national initiatives including Make-in-India, Return-to-India and Atmanirbhar Bharat that are designed to expand and enrich the Indian start-up ecosystem. The introduction of AI-powered eGovernance platform, the UPI system, and other soon to be introduced digital investments such as official digital currency of India represent the initiatives of the Indian Government that showcase Indian social DeepTech applications to transcend the enterprise applications of the Deep Technologies.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">The Indian DeepTech future is vibrant given the progress made by DeepTech start-ups and a new class of entrepreneurs in multiple sectors that has contributed immensely to the organic growth of the DeepTech ecosystem in India. Further growth would come, as, in their pursuit to hone niche tech capabilities and broaden their product offering as they pursue digitalization; several large corporations and enterprises are expected to acquire DeepTech start-ups that hold potential to solve some of the world’s most complex problems. Some attractive domains in the Indian DeepTech landscape include cloud-native technologies, quantum computing, cybersecurity mesh and customer data platforms.</p>

                <div class="card-body p-5 textless">
                  <p class=" m-0">The DeepTech start-ups mostly work in areas including AI, computer science,
                    agriculture, life sciences, chemistry, clean energy, aerospace and industry, and often have
                    applications that can benefit more than one sector. Being game changers, DeepTech start-ups can be
                    seen using aerospace technologies to monitor crop conditions or advanced AI to monitor a patient or
                    produce clean energy. Unlike shallow tech start-ups, DeepTech companies often own IPs such as
                    patents, and come into being after having spent several years in a laboratory or researching and
                    testing a novel technology. DeepTech start-ups also need huge, long-term capital investments to
                    support research and to being their technologies to commercial markets. Since their technologies are
                    disruptive in nature, the time to market frame tends to be longer for commercial success.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">On the positive side, once these companies overcome hurdles and finally commercialize
                    their technology, they bring entirely new concepts to market that disrupt the existing applications
                    or working models. These technologies are difficult replicate, do not face competition, and
                    therefore create higher value for companies. A case in point is fintech start-ups that used
                    blockchain technologies to allow users to bank from their smartphones with highest level of security
                    with decreased costs. Their model disrupted the conventional way of banking interlaced with high
                    banking charges and cumbersome bureaucratic processes. Consider DNA sequencing, CAD (computer-aided
                    design) and 3D printing that have increased the accessibility of and accelerated the design, testing
                    and prototype stages.</p>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong> Convergence of Technologies & Approaches -</strong> The convergence of diverse
                      technologies and approaches extends options, fuels innovation and solves issues that are
                      challenging for existing options to overcome. DeepTech relies heavily on convergence of different
                      approaches that starts with problem solving or the design step through identification & framing of
                      the problem, context analysis, and creation of an idea. While science brings the theory to support
                      the solution, engineering aids commercial and technical viability. Companies are maintaining a
                      consistent focus on science and engineering right from the start of problem solving as they can
                      remarkably influence potential solutions. DeepTech is also betting on emerging technologies for
                      better outcomes from their endeavors. Cognition and computation are transforming industries and
                      have resulted in exciting developments like robotics, the IoT and autonomous vehicles with their
                      integration with motion and sensing. DeepTech innovation is set to receive a major stimulus from
                      the progress associated with nanotechnology coupled with gene sequencing, writing and editing
                      techniques. Ongoing efforts by the researcher community to develop next-generation tools for
                      enabling designs and innovations at the nano scale are poised to help ventures in tapping the
                      nature for sophisticated product designs. Addition of the aspect with intriguing capabilities in
                      cognition, computation, motion, sensors, energy and matter is slated to help DeepTech in providing
                      answers to pressing problems. The integration of AI and bio-printing for making predictions
                      related to folding of proteins is bound to transform medicine and drug discovery. The use of AI
                      for designing genetic constructs along with robotic process automation for building and testing
                      these constructs is poised to push organism programing significantly forward. On the other hand,
                      bio-fabrication techniques relying on sophisticated AI, biological engineering and automation are
                      anticipated to allow development of novel materials. Moreover, various DeepTech players are
                      converging laser physics, machine learning and stem cell biology for turning adult cells into
                      desired stem cells. Players related to physics are working with fusion-grade systems for enabling
                      abundant clean energy. In the coming years, DeepTech start-ups are expected to exploit
                      problem-solving orientation for bringing together emerging technologies in unique ways to enable
                      exciting innovation opportunities.</li>
                    <li><strong> DeepTech Vs. Shallow Tech -</strong> DeepTech is quite different from ‘shallow tech’ in
                      the sense that the latter refers to relatively simple technological advancements that enable a
                      business to move from a conventional, non-digital working model to a completely digital model.
                      Unlike DeepTech advances that are difficult for competitors to imitate, shallow tech advances are
                      rather easy to replicate and do not disrupt the market in any form. As a case in point, shallow
                      tech adoption has enabled the delivery service earlier available through telephone to be digitally
                      offered through a mobile phase app or a brick-and-mortar bookshop offering digital download of
                      e-books. Even the Uber hail-a-cab service that disrupted the cab/taxi services market does not
                      feed on DeepTech, as the business only leveraged an already existing sharing economy concept and
                      developed a new platform using readily available and pre-existing digital technologies.</li>
                    <li><strong> CEE DeepTech Start-ups -</strong> Some of the DeepTech start-ups making waves in the
                      CEE space include Arlabion, an agri-tech start-up dedicated to develop advanced agrochemicals that
                      can help with sustainable production of intensified crops; Eventech, which offers highly precise
                      measurements (2 – 3 picoseconds) for high-tech event timing; and Conelum, a biotech start-up
                      established in 2012, to develop rapid microbiological diagnostics for food and beverage companies.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong> Targeting DBTL Cycle -</strong> The design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle mitigates
                      risks and expedited product development and time-to-market by connecting the problem to
                      technologies. Like the lean build-measure-learn loop, DBTL offers advantages such as agility and
                      speed while supporting advances. In contrast to the build-measure-learn loop that is associated
                      with bits or software, DBTL covers both bits and atoms. DBTL encompasses emerging technologies
                      such as artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing, quantum-based algorithms, advanced
                      sensing and robotics to push development time. The multi-dimensional design phase associated with
                      the approach offers competitive edge and allows faster evolution of technologies. The de-risking
                      role of DBTL for DeepTech goes beyond the market risk and covers the whole venture. The design
                      component of the cycle holds critical relevance and value. Factors such as swift access to desired
                      information along with powerful and affordable computing systems expedite the hypothesis-driven
                      approach and allow designing of novel models with ease. Prototypes can be scanned and equipped
                      with sensors for offering real-time performance data, which can be exploited as feedback for
                      co-designing of the object. Technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality are opening
                      opportunities to design virtual products for enhanced precision, design improvement and cost
                      savings. Rising accessibility of sophisticated technologies is anticipated to attract more
                      ventures to tap them for product designs. The concept is poised to gain further from quantum
                      computers with potential to process considerable amount of calculations and data while edging over
                      traditional machines on the basis of algorithm execution speed, opening avenues for
                      computation-based efforts. In the coming years, quantum computing is expected to significantly
                      transform fluid dynamics, materials design, chemicals and biopharmaceuticals. The build & test

                      organisms for building advanced robots. However, the field is restricted to development of few
                      prototypes due to limited knowledge about behavior of these materials that makes it challenging
                      for researchers to activate and control soft materials for desired applications. While quantum
                      computing holds significant potential to transform numerous domains, the technology is facing
                      various challenges that are hindering overall progress. In addition, researchers are yet to

                      finding the right people resources and/or complementary corporate infrastructure create hurdles
                      for commercialization. Lack of sufficient market intelligence data, inadequate data about overseas
                      markets and improper use of available data all make up for marketing challenges.</li>
                    <li><strong> Legal, Industrial, and Cultural Challenges -</strong>DeepTech commercialization could
                      also be hindered by legal, industrial and cultural challenges. Non-compliance with industry or
                      cultural laws could land DeepTech start-ups in legal battles. For instance, biotechnology
                      companies face numerous industry challenges when they seek to enter the Asian markets where
                      regulatory environment is stringent with respect to food safety, biosafety and ethics. Asian
                      cultures are also diverse, which present cultural challenges such as the ones faced by
                      biotechnology companies. Asian people with certain origins may oppose use of genes derived from
                      certain animals owing to their religious beliefs.</li>
