                  <p class=" m-0">Being a significant contributor to carbon emissions, transportation offers impressive opportunities for participants to shift towards innovative and upcoming technologies to contribute to de-carbonization efforts. In order to play a highly constructive role in de-carbonization goals, the sector needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% over 2020-2050, indicating the pressing need to move from fossil fuel-powered vehicles towards electrification. Electric vehicles are heading towards major transportation transformations that are estimated to dramatically reduce total greenhouse gas emissions related to the sector by 2050. Electric vehicles have gained significant attention after the introduction of impressive models by Tesla along with the popularity of advanced hybrids. Electric passenger vehicles are rapidly gaining ground and pushing their share in overall sales of vehicles globally. Stringent regulatory policies like the Zero Emission Vehicle regulation in California, the European Union’s carbon emissions standards covering new vehicles, and the New Energy Vehicle policy in China are setting a perfect stage for electric vehicles and latest de-carbonization efforts. These policies are prompting automakers to increase the share of zero-emission vehicles and focusing more on electrification of the transportation sector. In addition, de-carbonization is anticipated to gain from extension of the electrification trend beyond typical passenger vehicles to micro-mobility solutions like auto-rickshaws, bikes and scooters. </p>
                  <br/>
                  <p class=" m-0">Increasing affordability of lithium-ion batteries is poised to bolster the demand for electric transportation options on the expense of traditional vehicles powered by fossil fuels. The success of de-carbonization goals also depends on efforts to push generation of clean energy and its supply to the power grid. Continuing trend towards generation of clean energy along with strong potential of batteries used in electric vehicles for storage of electricity is expected to help companies in the power sector deal with intermittent nature of renewable resources. These factors are poised to help electric vehicles in contributing to de-carbonization of the power sector while paving for a greener transportation. Electric vehicles are anticipated to gain further from implementation of policy changes and increasing affordability of associated technologies along with massive shift towards clean energy. Rising production of solar and wind is anticipated to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions of electric vehicles through their lifecycle. In addition, consumers are expected to play a critical role in de-carbonization of the electric vehicle supply chain. Rising consumer demand is prompting an increasing number of companies to embrace the technology and come up with new models for satiating demand and reducing their carbon footprint. </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Even as the pandemic led to painful and drastic shrinking of sales and production of conventional cars, EVs manage to elude the trend. In 2020, electric vehicle was the lone bright spot for the automotive industry with market penetration increasing to over 4% of total vehicle sales. The year 2021 additionally witnessed growth further increase with penetration rates doubling to over 8% to 9% of the global automotive industry. Interestingly, a large chunk of the global net growth in vehicle sales in 2021 came only from EVs. EV manufacturers, over the last two years, have successfully managed to fend off supply chain bottlenecks which impacted OEMs of fossil fuel vehicles. This is largely because of stringent CO2 regulations and EV targets legislated in Europe and North America. While it is true that auto OEMs faced and still continue to face sourcing challenges of not just semiconductors but also other raw materials such as plastics, lithium, steels and among others, the prioritization of chips into high-margin vehicles have largely benefited EVs. Chip shortages coupled with stricter CO2 legislations have indirectly incentivized OEMs to produce more EVs than they would otherwise have done. To meet tough CO2 targets manufacturers have come under pressure to increase supply of EVs so as to ensure compliance to slated CO2 targets. </p>

                  <br />
                  <p class=" m-0">In short, aggressive CO2 fleet targets such as those imposed in EU have forced OEMs to sell more low/zero emission vehicles to meet targets and avoid heavy penalties and fines. This explains the big influx of EVs in 2020 and 2021 at a time when the automotive industry was grappling with massive challenges on the economic and supply chain front. Also, in China, Europe and the US, purchase subsidies for EVs were increased and expanded during the last two years. In China, for instance, the government extended electric car subsidies for two more years after the pandemic broke out, although subject to a planned reduction in the coming years. While ambitious targets have encouraged OEMs to develop and launch more attractive electric models into the market, robust government subsidies have helped shield EVs atleast partially from rising prices stemming from tight supplies for components and increases in the prices of bulk materials (commodities). These subsidies have therefore helped retain customer interest in and affordability of EVs as compared to conventional vehicles where increase in cost of production was directly transferred to consumer. Also, several Chinese EV manufacturers have remained unaffected by chip shortage and continue to focus on producing premium smart electric vehicles with high-end chips. This is largely because the smaller volume of EV manufacturers makes managing chip inventories more manageable as compared to larger OEMs who will need chipsets in far greater quantities. Also most chips used in EVs are not mass market and are used in mid to high-end vehicle segment which currently has a relatively lower penetration rate.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p class="m-0">The industry is also witnessing exciting developments from leading automakers from China and other countries that are set to take the EV revolution next step forward. Continuing advances in technology and the automotive industry are anticipated to help electric vehicles in gaining broader acceptance and play a critical role in pushing the world towards a sustainable future. Upcoming models from leading automakers are poised to take the EV domain by storm and expand the customer base while allowing countries to achieve their zero-emission targets. From sophisticated and sporty to affordable and convenient, these new models are anticipated to garner tremendous attention with their compelling features. With extended range, enhanced safety and powerful performance, upcoming models of electric vehicles are likely to match the performance associated with conventional internal combustion engine cars. The electric vehicle domain is witnessing intense competition due to increasing focus of companies to gain an edge over rivals and dominate the market by offering innovative and next-generation models. Some of the players are betting on incredible EVs and exciting digital experiences for customers. These companies are spending big on R&D to push the range while establishing electric vehicles as a reliable option for commuting within cities and on highways.</p>

                <div class="card-body p-5 textless">
                  <p class=" m-0">How things would play out in 2023 and beyond will be largely driven by certain key
                    trends in the area of corporate diversity, in addition to the actions that leaders would take around
                    these trends.</p>
                  <br />
<ul>
  <li><strong>	China Will Continue to be a Major Player -</strong> The rise of China as the global EV leader has undoubtedly placed the country ahead of the US, as well as Europe and Japan. China framed a set of policies that not just helped its local companies gain access to EV technology but also gain control of EV supply chain, covering all important inputs right from cathodes, anodes, electrolytes and separators to key raw materials, including cobalt, lithium and neodymium among others. As the Chinese government implemented multiple pro-PEV policies, encompassing subsidies favoring local companies, domestic production quotas, and forceful technology transfer, some important questions are being raised such as violation of international trade norms. Interestingly, the country’s biggest trading partner, the US, has never raised objection despite being in position to hold China accountable for trade violations. Indeed, the US, Japan and Europe have been rather unsuccessful in chalking out strategies to offset China’s control over the EV supply chain. Another major impediment has been to make China accountable. Without forcing the American firms or workers serving the US market out of PEV business, China simply favored local companies and workforce to strengthen its PEV industry, and allowed Chinese firms to compete in the US market provided they first dominate the domestic market. Despite the availability of trade policy tools, including the WTO agreements, domestic laws that provide trade remedies, and restricting imports that violate US IP (intellectual property) law or threaten national security, American policymakers have not been able to counter China’s policies and practices. These policies are constrained by several factors, including the need to show that import volumes are negatively affecting a US industry or are threatening its national security. China has been extremely creative in devising policies to gain supply chain dominance, capture ownership interest in raw materials and components involved in EV production.</li>
  <li><strong>	Localizing the EV Supply Chain Becomes the Focus for Sustainable Growth of EVs - </strong> The EVs and the very essential batteries (including the battery metals) have a supply chain network that is innately global and interconnected, making it vulnerable to disruptions. Localization could ensure EV supply chain remains resilient to unpredictable catastrophes, and fuel sustainable growth of EVs. This would require a vertically integrated approach to the EV and battery value chain. A few vanguard companies such as Northvolt, a battery maker, are heading in this direction. Northvolt has been securing the supply of important components by sourcing them mostly locally. Companies could also consider investments in sourcing raw materials that are environmentally sustainable so that they rely less on a rather well-established Asian supply chain. A localized supply chain is greater on reliability and always comes with a reduced environmental footprint, which resonates well with the concept of an EV, towards a zero-emissions future. Shifting mineral supplies to nearby locations could help automakers, especially western automakers, to bring agility to their manufacturing operations, as they can react swiftly to any disruption and remain largely resilient to trade wars or other geopolitical events. On a macro-level, a country could strengthen its domestic workforce and address unemployment. An integrated supply chain for western nations and automakers would mean a tighter control over raw materials, components and manufacturing, and economic benefits such as a more controlled inflation and improved employment opportunities. A more resilient, localized sourcing of battery mineral would herald a positive outlook for EV growth, with such benefits in the backdrop as more restored local jobs (which has been lost to Asian nations), a more robust and minimal wastage carbon footprint and overall, an improved economy.</li>
  <li><strong>	Innovations in Battery Will Take EVs Mainstream -</strong> Battery technology is the most crucial aspect for adoption and growth of EVs across the world. While Li-ion and lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries dominant EV battery market type at present, they have to their name several drawbacks along with benefits with regard to raw material, raw material properties, range and cost. There is greater push from automobile makers and battery companies for batteries that are lighter, denser and cheaper to build, and hence the huge investments in this space. The need for innovation is encouraging some to make incremental improvements to existing/conventional battery chemistries, and some to alter the battery assembly or battery form factor to derive cost or performance benefits. Though it is theoretically considered possible for batteries to have a long driving range, several factors such as cost, safety, reliability, and durability have to be still addressed. Continued, proactive research and development in the EV space has started to deliver revolutionary outcomes that could help future EV batteries gain sustainable, power-efficient and long-haul tag. Some of the ground-breaking technology ideas include StoreDot developing biological semiconductor-based EV batteries that could complete charging in five minutes and deliver a 300 mile driving range; Graphenano developing a Graphene-based battery with potential to provide a 500 mile range with just a few minutes of single charge; and uBeam proposing to use ultrasound charging to power EVs. There are many more ongoing developments, including Carbon Nanotube Electrodes, Cobalt-Free Batteries, Seawater Batteries, Sand Batteries, Silicon Anode Batteries, Structural Component Batteries, Low-cost Zinc-Air Batteries, New Solid-State Battery, NanoBolt Lithium Tungsten Batteries, Zinc Manganese Oxide Batteries, Organosilicon Electrolyte Batteries, Gold Nanowire Gel Electrolyte Batteries, and TankTwo String Cell Batteries. </li>
  <li><strong>	Shared EV Charging Will Rise as a Solution to Charging Infrastructure Bottlenecks - </strong>The EV infrastructure issue is highlighting the critical relevance of charger sharing that can ensure charging availability for a large number of EV owners. The number of domestic chargers across various countries significantly exceeds the number of public charging connections. These factors are indicating the significance of a sharing economy. People with home chargers can offer the facility to others using specific systems for enabling shared charging. The option is available on a specific pricing structure and timeslots to help people owing home chargers in accounting for their electricity and charger installation costs. Unlike other battery-powered devices like mobile phones that are often charged daily, electric vehicles are charges as per the requirement, which is generally once in a week. In addition, the availability of shared charging reduces the reliance on charging infrastructure by providing electric vehicle owners with the convenience to charge their vehicles nearby. Shared charging is also gaining due to its ability to address accessibility issues associated with the charging infrastructure. Various people, including individuals with specific disabilities, find it challenging to locate a charger for their charging requirements. Moreover, there are issues related to connection and disconnection using heavy cables. Home shared charging is anticipated to address majority of issues pertaining to the charging infrastructure. In addition, shared charging is poised to make people feel comfortable about owing electric vehicles and mitigate issues regarding access to charging facilities.</li>
  <li><strong>	Electric Vehicle Polymers Hit the Spotlight for Lightweighting Benefits - </strong> The EV industry is therefore expected to witness the transition from high-temperature performance engineering polymers towards PE for engine parts as the former are not needed in electric battery engines. The increasing uptake of PE parts is also favored by their ability to reduce weight, improve safety and support customization to cater to specific requirements of electric vehicles. Based its lower cost in comparison to metal parts, PE components are bound to emerge as a cost-efficient option for companies to push bottom lines. Polymers help in the reduction of harshness, vibrations and noise (NVH) values, improve durability and help in making the automobile lightweight. Since polymers have high strength and high-heat tolerance properties, they enhance vehicle safety. They are also cheaper than traditionally used materials such as metals and glass as they can directly be injected into the molds of the vehicle. Polymers can also be customized using various colors and sheen. Since it is easy to add chemicals to polymers, the end-product is scratch and UV resistant. All these properties reduce the assembly steps leading to a decrease in overall price for the end-user. Thus, the role of polymers has become critical as they are an integral raw material of EVs. Various polymers such as Polyamide, ABS, Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Polyurethane (PU), sulphide polyamide and Polypropylene (PP) are used in manufacturing various components of EVs. With more and more automobile manufacturers making electric cars, it is anticipated that the demand for polymers will continue to increase. Even self-driving cars function on emission of different waves and polymers are important in this case as the waves are not disrupted by any barrier. Polymers also help in avoiding Faraday’s cage effect. The solution to all these problems is plastronics which means integrating electronic circuits in plastic.

  </li>

  <li><strong>	Electrification of Last Mile Delivery Will Gain in Prominence -  </strong>Electric vehicles (EVs) are set to electrify and considerably move forward the idea of last-mile delivery in a highly sustainable and cost-efficient manner for players eying on the e-commerce boom. While traditional vehicles are suitable for last mile delivery, their association with greenhouse gas emissions is prompting an increasing number of logistics companies to embrace electric vehicles that hold attractive benefits over their counterpart fuel-intensive vehicles. The rising adoption of electric vehicles for last mile operations is attributed to their lower operational and maintenance costs than internal combustion engine-based vehicles. These vehicles are also benefitting from government regulations and policies to reduce emissions associated with rising last mile deliveries.

The ability of AI-powered systems to recognize trends presents potential in the smart charging of EVs in order to stabilize the grid and manage peak demand. The exponential growth of EVs has led to an increase in energy demand, burdening the electrical infrastructure. The term smart charging refers to a system capable of monitoring, using and limiting the use of charging devices to optimize energy consumption. In this scenario, AI algorithms can be leveraged to drastically the charge-times of lithium-ion batteries. For example, GBatteries’ ChargeSense is capable of ultra-fast charging lithium-ion batteries without compromising cycle life. The solution utilizes self-learning and pulse charging algorithms to monitor the battery in real-time and optimize charging. Reducing the charge time is expected to provide the necessary impetus to adoption of EVs, thus boosting the role of AI in EV’s ecosystem.</li>
  <li><strong>	Li-ion Battery Recycling to Receive Major Impetus – </strong> Batteries contain several toxic chemicals and heavy metals and their disposal through the same process as used for disposing standard household waste has been raising concerns over water pollution and soil contamination.  The Li-ion battery recycling market is heading for big gains as a result of ongoing efforts related to innovations in battery recycling techniques intended to address various issues associated with traditional approaches. Li-ion batteries are extensively used in a comprehensive spectrum of consumer electronic items and poised to benefit from the electric vehicle boom. The increasing use of these batteries is poised to create a massive heap of spent Li-ion batteries in the coming years, requiring stakeholders to push recycling efforts. Recycling holds critical relevance for battery makers due to the pressing need to deal with the glut of batteries with huge negative implications for the environment. By 2030, around 11 million metric tons of these batteries are predicted to reach end of their service life. The significant scrap volume along with increasing production of batteries in line with rising popularity of electric vehicles indicates the requirement of recycling techniques to extract valuable materials from spent batteries and reduce the burden on mining, landfills and the environment. Materials recovered from used batteries can be used in new Li-ion batteries to reduce production costs. The significance of extracted materials is also attributed to highly volatile prices of nickel and cobalt. Effective and cost-effective recycling and material recovery is bound to make Li-ion batteries more affordable. In addition, recycling of battery materials is slated to play an important role in reducing burden on landfills, which also holds risk for groundwater and soil contamination.</li>
  <li><strong>	Biogas for EV Charging to Arrive Soon - </strong> While electric vehicles are being increasingly touted as a sustainable and more environment-friendly alternative to high-polluting fossil-fuel based transport, it still cannot deny the fact that the energy source used for powering these vehicles continue to have a large carbon footprint. One alternative that is being evaluated for addressing the environmental issues related to electric vehicles is to use biogas for charging electric vehicles in place of electricity. Biogas, a naturally occurring and renewable energy source, can be produced from organic matter, such as food waste, green waste, sewage, plant material, municipal waste, manure, and agricultural waste. A biomethane plant can be set up in close proximity to an electric vehicle charging station for producing biogas, which in turn can be fed in purified form into a genset for producing electricity, which can subsequently be used for charging electric vehicles. This way, instead of using fossil fuels, electric vehicles can be charged using renewable power, making a point in favor of electric vehicles being truly at the forefront of combating climate change. In a recent major development, California Congressman John Garamendi introduced the Biomass and Biogas for Electric Vehicles Act. The legislation aims at directing the US Environment Protection Agency (EPA) to provide for the generation of renewable identification numbers under the renewable fuel program to allow biomass facilities producing renewable electricity to be able to participate in the federal renewable fuel standard (RFS) program.</li>
