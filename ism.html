                  <p class=" m-0">Israel is enjoying spotlight for its highly dynamic and fertile ecosystem for technology startups due to its inherent culture and immense support to innovations and R&D activity. Despite its small size and population, the country has experienced tremendous progress regarding its startup culture. With over 6000 active startups, Israel is popular as the startup nation and holds the leadership position in terms of startups per capita. Israeli startups secure more venture capital per person in comparison to other countries globally. These startups are making waves with their innovations and technology that are transforming the world in a positive way. The Israeli startup landscape extends from Tel Aviv, the technology hub, through to Jerusalem and Beersheba. These innovation centers are witnessing mushrooming of technology startups with potential to turn their unique ideas into reality to serve a comprehensive spectrum of industry verticals. The phenomenal success story in the country can be credited to a number of favorable factors and strengths. The country boasts a favorable financial and business climate, a robust technology sector, educated workforce, supportive government policies and innovative culture. Moreover, Israel is one of the most reliable and appealing investment regions for financial partners. These factors have set a perfect landscape for expansion of the startup ecosystem in the country, and are poised to continue accelerating the pace of technological innovation.</p>
               
                  <p class=" m-0">Israel is known for a vibrant startup ecosystem that is powering ahead with time and predicted to maintain its shape in the coming years. The thriving startup ecosystem in the country is gaining from the questioning culture, strong focus on education, mandatory national military service, risk-taking ability and extensive use of English. Most high-tech startups in the country have been founded by former members of Israelâ€™s elite military intelligence units like the Unit 8200 Intelligence division. In addition, students in the country are exposed to new and sophisticated computing units due to the robust cultural push for technology. Technology remains an appealing opportunity in Israel as software professionals earn considerably higher in comparison to conventional professions. The startup culture in the country has been garnering notable momentum since the late 1980s and the early 1990s, with the Yozma Programme from the Israeli government playing a key role. The program offered appealing tax incentives to international VCs in the country and vowed to double the investment with government funds. The move along with favorable policies attracted a large number of players and prompted major technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Samsung to set up their R&D units and accelerators in Israel. Startup funding along with M&A activity in the country has increased exponentially over the past decade, enabling startups to secure record funding. Israeli startups and late-stage players enjoyed significant gains over 2019-2021 before experiencing a difficult phase brought by effects of the pandemic and a number of other factors. Some of the startups that delivered impressive performance in the recent years were associated with domains like Fintech, cyber-security, food technology and the Internet of Things. While Israel remains renowned for cybersecurity startups, the AI technology and associated players are playing a vital role in driving investments. In addition, investors are paying attention to companies related to e-commerce, cyber-security and remote technologies for healthcare and work. There are several technology startups in the country that enjoy notable value. While the pandemic slowed down early-round investments, they gained pace gradually. In addition, a large number of startups in Israel quickly adapted to the situation and embraced video conferencing and other technologies to push funding and attract investors. Remote working proved to be a boon for distant startup ecosystems such as that of Israel. The startup ecosystem in the country is receiving a major contribution from Tel Aviv, Herzliya and Jerusalem that represent the primary hubs for technology scenario. The high-tech economy is also receiving significant support from the government that has announced various programs to foster startups. Israel is also working on pushing engagement with Arab Israelis, who account for 20% of the population but hold low share in the technology domain. The government has introduced the Hybrid Program to address the disparity. The move is poised to play an important role in facilitating business and involvement of people from diverse communities. </p>

                    amazing and remarkable startup culture in the country. Israeli startups, innovations and technology
                    have long been creating waves and influencing the world with unique concepts and solutions. Startups
                    from the country are attracting notable funding and investments owing to their compelling solutions.
                    In addition, Israeli startups are receiving immense support from the close network and VCs. In the
                    recent years, Israeli startups have come up with unique ideas spanning diverse industries and
                    verticals, resulting in immense support from investors. StoreDot, a battery storage firm from Tel
                    Aviv, has secured notable funding from players such as Samsung Ventures for its sophisticated
                    battery that is capable of fully-charging a motor scooter within few minutes. Set up in 1993,
                    Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP) has invested in a large number of companies and secured notable
                    funding to emerge as one of the reliable VC funds. The company focuses on startups exploring
                    technologies associated with big data, cyber-security, media technologies, storage, and enterprise
                    software. On the other hand, equity-based crowd-funding platforms such as OurCrowd are supporting
                    Israeli startups seeking funding by offering investment options to accredited investors. Some of
                    these players are betting on smart manufacturing that is embracing industrial IoT technologies,
                    including food & beverage, automotive, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Israeli startups are making
                    significant progress related to sophisticated cyber-security solutions that can protect industrial
                    networks against cyber-attacks. Some of these companies are offering secure keyless communications
                    to support site-to-cloud, site-to-site, IoT and mobile initiatives in dealing with security gaps
                    within existing encryption protocols. Attaining growth, creating networks and positively influencing
                    the world, Israeli startups are expanding to new domains, including innovative medical technologies

                  <p class=" m-0">Israel is at the forefront of startup ecosystem and technological innovations due to
                    confluence of a number of favorable factors, including its people along with the need for
                    self-reliance. The thriving ecosystem is credited to the Government Innovation Policy, military
                    forces and a culture of collaboration and diversity. The country boasts some of the renowned
                    universities that manage R&D hubs, presenting impressive incubation centers for boosting
                    innovations. A decent fraction of the countryâ€™s population is engaged with the high-tech industry
                    and contributing to its export GDP. Israeli startups are attracting significant investments and
                    making considerably in exits. The country is secures the third-leading position in total number of
                    companies listed on NASDAQ. Israel has made aggressive efforts over the past several decades to
                    promote innovations and new technology, which have resulted in a thriving startup ecosystem in the
                    country. Considering limited opportunities in the local market, Israeli startups maintain a
                    consistent focus on the international market right from their inception. While Israel enjoys the
                    third slot globally in terms of patents registered in the US, there are a large number of R&D
                    centers managed by tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, HP and Facebook, adding to the innovation
                    wave. Israel also scores high in terms of exports of solutions associated with life science and
                    technology sectors. Israelis are characterized by their entrepreneurial spirit as they are exposed
                    to different thinking pattern right from their early years. The attitude can be attributed to the
                    countryâ€™s mandatory military service that presents an impressive training landscape and builds
                    networks of human capital. All citizens of the country are required to serve the Israel Defense
                    Forces (IDF) after completing 18 years for a period of two or more years. The training period
                    provides them with the opportunity to deal with challenging situations and sophisticated
                    technologies. The training eventually helps them in acquiring technical skills and gaining from the
                    extensive network of the IDF. In terms of capital, Israel presents abundant opportunities through
                    the lifecycle of a company, including VCs, angels, pre-IPO funds, growth funds, debt providers and
                    secondary buyers. The country holds a large number of incubators, accelerators and co-working
                    spaces. In addition, there is ambitious, long-term support from the government, including grants or
                    funding for companies and desired tax regimes for founders and investors. Regarding funding, Israel
                    allows international entrepreneurs to set up their base in the country. Entrepreneur decisions are
                    also influenced by the Tnufa National Pre-seed Fund, a risk-free grant awarded by government to
                    entrepreneurs in the country for exploring innovative technology and developing ideas without
                    venture capital or debt. Considering the ease of selling early, the country is witnessing notable
                    increase in number of unicorns. The startup ecosystem in Israel is also favored by the presence of
                    numerous research centers run by some of the leading international technology companies. VCs,
                    incubators, accelerators and industry programs such as JVP and JVP Media Labs along with WeWork,
                    Cyberspark, TAU and SOSA are offering commendable support to startups. Israel is marked by an
                    environment of collaboration and openness, with various entrepreneurs giving back to the startup
                    ecosystem and supporting innovation and upcoming players. The country is now making serious efforts
                    to move from the startup status to emerge as the scale-up nation.</p>

                  <p class=" m-0">Israel has earned laurels of being the startup nation as it boasts sophisticated
                    technologies and plethora of thriving startups within the technology domain. The country is
                    characterized by its booming startup culture being fostered by a well-established infrastructure
                    coupled with strong government support and human capital. With a population of around 9.1 million,
                    the country is a home to more than 6,000 startups. Israel is the only country after China and the US
                    that have the highest number of companies listed on the NASDAQ. The entrepreneurship culture in
                    Israel is getting a high-dose injection of innovation as premier technology startups in the country
                    are coming up with unique solutions spanning a comprehensive array of domains. Israeli startups
                    score over their counterparts in various countries in terms of funding and represent appealing
                    targets for acquisition. The tremendous success of the country in startups can be credited to the
                    business-friendly landscape and policy support that allows Israeli entrepreneurs to come up with
                    innovative solutions. The country is gaining from high-quality education, skilled immigrants, an
                    extensive international network, and access to financing. Startup success in Israel also attributed
                    to the mandatory military service, scarcity of natural resources, pressing need for self-reliance,
                    governmentâ€™s immigration policy and the culture of diversity. The startup culture in the country is
                    anticipated to continue thriving with significant investments in R&D activity, connectivity, the
                    risk-taking behavior and acquisition of technical know-how during the military training period. </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="font-weight-bold">Factors Fostering Startup Culture in Israel</p>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Favorable Policy Framework -</strong> Government policies and initiatives are playing a
                      crucial role in emergence of Israel as one of the main powerhouses in the field of science and
                      technology. Israel maintains a consistent focus on significant investments in education and
                      support immigration for strengthening human capital. The government has created a favorable
                      framework to support new businesses while announcing various policy initiatives like R&D programs,
                      network institutions and tax-related frameworks. The government is offering investment incentives
                      to attract foreign investors and making notable investments in R&D, which is higher than the
                      investment level in other industrialized nations. In addition, the government has implemented
                      venture capital programs for successful conversion of research and innovative ideas into reality.
                      Public policies in the country have led to a business-friendly landscape that is fostering
                      innovations and supporting initiatives taken by the private sector through financing, regulatory
                      framework, education and infrastructure. The government offers university research and technology
                      transfer programs, incubators and subsidized venture capital. The strong focus of Israel on R&D
                      can be credited to factors such as scarcity of land and natural resources, few avenues for
                      national growth and the political landscape that limits most businesses to neighboring nations.
                      These limitations are prompting Israel to focus on the human capital along with innovative
                      solutions that can be sold on the international market.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong Focus on Education -</strong> The thriving entrepreneurial culture in Israel is
                      credited to its unwavering attention on education along with the cultural focus on factors such as
                      risk-taking and self-initiative. The lack of natural resources in the country has resulted in
                      strong focus on approaches to push human capital and value-added products and services. Israel is
                      making significant investments into education, with its half of the workforce holding the tertiary
                      education level. The education network in Israel encompasses schools and universities along with
                      the military, where all citizens are required to engage in for two or more years. The military
                      provides people with advanced knowledge related to technology and engineering. The factor has
                      enabled Israel to surpass countries such as the US and Germany in terms of the number of engineers
                      per capita. In addition, the country makes notable investment in R&D activity, leading to large
                      number of full-time researchers, technical and scientific journal articles. Moreover, Israel
                      focuses on value-added manufacturing, with a major fraction of manufacturing exports from the
                      country representing high-tech products. </li>
                    <li><strong>Mandatory Military Service - </strong>The mandatory military service for all people
                      above the age of 18 is one of the key proponents of entrepreneurship in Israel. Some of the
                      renowned founders of companies in the country have served 8200, the Israeli Intelligence Corps
                      unit dedicated to collect signal intelligence and code decryption. The 8200 is no more a secretive
                      unit and shares its proficiency by becoming a highly popular pool for organizations looking for
                      bright people in specific areas of technology such as engineering and communications. The Israeli
                      Defense Force has also produced a large number of CEOs and founders. In addition, women in the
                      country serve all positions on the military equally and promoted on the basis of merit instead of
                      gender. The significant contribution of the military in fostering the entrepreneurship in the
                      country is attributed to the fact that the service provides young women and men with advanced
                      technological training. Israeli military selects people on the basis of merit and trains them at
                      next-generation computing units, assigning young engineers with the responsibility to manage
                      challenging projects. The military environment is intentionally designed to ensure minimal
                      guidance from seniors for compelling young soldiers to improvise and deal with challenges to
                      compete assigned tasks. The environment is playing an important role in creating youngsters who
                      learn from failures and can take chances. Moreover, the process results in innovative and
                      disciplined professionals that can work hard and take risks. </li>
                    <li><strong>Unique Culture - </strong>Israeli is a unique blend of Jewish, American, European and
                      sub-ethnic Levantine cultures and customs. The country has witnessed influx of Jewish people from
                      the US, Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa over the past century. The modern society in Israel is
                      a fusion of Western and Eastern influences that have led to a shared and unique culture. In
                      addition, Israelis are known for their risk-taking, openness and individualism along with the
                      ability to think freely, debate, speak out and question the status quo. Majority of businesses in
                      the country seek individuals who are risk takers and independent thinkers, which holds particular
                      relevance for the high-tech field that is commonly associated with risk taking. There are various
                      entrepreneurs in Israel who come up with new ventures, push them and eventually sell them before
                      working on another venture. In addition, nearly one-fifth of the countryâ€™s population is
                      represented by Christians and Muslims that are working everywhere, from the parliament and
                      healthcare system through to industry and academia. The cultural diversity is notably contributing
                      to innovations and the startup culture. </li>
                    <li><strong>Immigration -</strong> The strong human capital in Israel is attributed to favorable
                      immigration policies that welcome Jews from different countries. A large number of these
                      immigrants are marked by high ambition, technical know-how, advanced degrees, focus on education
                      and unique approaches to problems. Accounting for a decent share of Israeli population, Soviet
                      Jews who immigrated to the country during the 1980s were leading in diverse fields such as
                      mathematics, science and engineering. These immigrants along with their children are contributing
                      to immense success enjoyed by the country. In addition, Israel is attracting skilled people from
                      different countries such as the US, the UK, Canada, France and Australia. The noteworthy influx of
                      skilled and highly ambitious professionals has helped Israel in scoring high in terms of
                      entrepreneurship-related initiatives. These immigrants are not only bringing high-tech skills, but
                      also enabling the country to connect to well-established international markets and network for
                      success.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business & Financial Climate -</strong> The strong focus of Israel on R&D investment and
                      innovations has resulted in proliferation of researchers, enabling the country to boast the
                      highest share of researchers. The education system and the military have led to a vibrant business
                      culture in the country with impressive work ethic. Business culture in Israel is characterized by
                      the attitude to risk taking and acceptance of failure as a part of innovation, a key component of
                      the startup culture. While closely-tied community allows startups to find partners, clustered
                      population and short geographical distances further support businesses. In addition, Israel is
                      gaining from a positive financial climate marked by high confidence of investors in the country.
                      Israel score over key countries such as Canada, Australia, Japan and China in terms of investor
                      confidence. The scenario is attributed to the presence of a favorable business environment, little
                      risk and better prospects. Israel also boasts the highest level of R&D investment globally as a
                      fraction of the GDP, leading to strong knowledge base and business developments. These factors are
                      enabling Israeli startups to secure the major fraction of investments from foreign players. </li>
                    <li><strong>Scarcity of Natural Resources -</strong> The abundance of natural resources in a country
                      is perceived to hinder economic growth and political modernization. On the other hand, countries
                      with no to limited natural resources are required to develop survival characteristics, strive for
                      becoming resourceful, and explore new approaches to do things in an optimized way. These traits
                      align with crucial characteristics of startups that are marked by few resources and must come up
                      with innovative ways for business expansion. Barring the recent gas discoveries, Israel had long
                      been relying on export of gas and development of alternative energy sources. In addition, the
                      country has been dealing with draught since its early years. The issue prompted Israel to
                      aggressively push desalination method for overcoming the persistent challenge. The technology has
                      enabled Israel to emerge as a water-independent nation. Water security has emerged as one of the
                      promising domains in the country and is anticipated to account for a notable share in exports in
                      the coming years. In addition, the country is expected to export the water technology to other
                      regions for dealing with drought.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Self-Reliance -</strong> Characterized by scarcity of natural resources and
                      numerous
                      enemies, Israel maintains a strong focus on self-reliance for survival. Since there are bleak
                      opportunities for normalization with neighboring countries and cross-border trade, Israel
                      follows a self-preservation approach. Startup founders in the country bet high on technological
                      innovations to taste success and survive in the highly competitive global market. Despite
                      holding a number of trading partners in the US and Europe, Israel faces a risk of economic
                      sanctions and trade embargo. The scenario prompts the country to aggressively push innovation
                      and create value-added products. In addition, startups are receiving significant support from
                      the government in terms of human capital development and research efforts for moving ahead in
                      the international market.</li>

                    investments. The smaller population of the country, relative to several other countries of the
                    world, also makes validating and testing ideas for newer markets, services, and products easier. The
                    top sectors for the nationâ€™s startup ecosystem so far have been the enterprise IT, data
                    infrastructure, security technologies and fintech sectors. Startups in these sectors attracted
                    majority of VC investment and other funding in the recent years. Here is a list of a few startups
                    that have taken the industries they are involved with by storm, capturing a considerable market
                    share in the initial years of their inception. </p>
