                    <p class=" m-0">Recent years have seen women founded companies grow in numbers, with a higher percentage of them also breaking into the unicorn club. Many start-ups are being co-founded by women, and even funded by women entrepreneurs. Stax, a payments company based in Florida; Globalization Partners, a global employment platform based in Boston; and Insider, a customer engagement service based in Singapore, all have women founder CEOs as their heads. Rising to the top and listed as unicorns are women founded Papaya Global, a human resource and payroll platform based in New York; Market Kurly, a premium food delivery company based in Seoul; and LaunchDarkly, a software feature management platform based in Oakland. Then there are biotechnology companies such as Humacyte, Immunocore and Lyell Immunopharma who have women CEOs. While many of these women-led start-ups and unicorns are private, there has been an increase in numbers of those who went public. Conversely, despite not being valued as unicorn in private financing, many have been valued over US$1 billion as they made their debut in public markets. Examples include Bumble, a dating app; FIGS, an apparel company; a.k.a., an online fashion brand; and Clear, a biometric identity company. Though they are yet to take a larger share of the market pie, the trend is clear that women leaders are here to make heads turn with their innovative business ideas. </p>

                    <br />
                      <p>Following are some of the top women leaders making waves in the business world:  </p>

                   
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Emily Weiss of Glossier:</strong> Founded by Emily Weiss and valued at US$1.8 billion, Glossier is a unicorn company with presence in the beauty industry. Beginning with “intothegloss.com”, her beauty blog that she started writing in 2010, E. Weiss amassed a massive following in four years, from where she headed to launch her own beauty company ‘Glossier’. She secured $1 million in funding from Forerunner Ventures that helped her launch her company with four products. Without aggressively addressing each aspect of the beauty sector, E. Weiss worked towards developing a core product offering. As she fine-tuned the core offering, she ventured into skincare, makeup, perfume and merchandise to successful gain foothold in various categories. The most interesting element in the success of Glossier is perhaps the blog that connects the company and its target audience. The company makes beauty products for its community, allows them to test its minimum viable product, and knows exactly what they want through the social channel. What makes the Glossier brand unique is positing of user-generated content online, which imparts a more community-driven, personal and authentic appeal.</li>
                      <li><strong>Melanie Perkins of Canva:</strong> Melanie Perkins holds all the secrets that aspiring women leaders can follow to enter women-led unicorn club. Just as E. Weiss, M. Perkins treaded her way with a humble beginning starting a yearbook design and publishing firm with Cliff Obrecht. M. Perkins, along with C. Obrecht and Cameron Adams founded Canva in 2013 as a full-fledged design platform for creating premium digital designs. The lady worked her way up to the unicorn status by staying focused on finding solution for some real-world problems. She successfully created a seamless user experience for all those facing difficulties in learning the graphic design process, which helped her raise the valuation of her company to US$40 billion. As of 2021, Canva addresses the needs of as many as 60 million monthly users across 190 countries. The founders are committed direct Canva’s revenues to solve some biggest world problems such as poverty. The founders also offer Canva’s premium services for free to non-profit organizations and teachers.</li>
                      
                      <li><strong>Tessa Wijaya of Xendit:</strong> Tessa Wijaya’s fintech company Xendit became a unicorn in September 2021. Just as M. Perkins, T. Wijaya worked towards resolving a real-world problem. Her journey began when she successfully landed the job of an analyst in a private equity firm all owing her strong mentality though she had no experience. With time, T. Wijaya gained prominence in the financial industry in Southeast Asia, and in 2015, she founded Xendit with the intention of bringing ride-hailing services and e-commerce closer in the region. By 2015, Xendit had emerged as one of the leading payment platforms in Southeast Asian countries including Indonesia and Philippines. Aspiring women leaders can take heed from T. Wijaya’s leadership traits that made her company become a unicorn. T. Wijaya is a mentor for women in the field of engineering, technology, mathematics and science.</li>


                      <li><strong>Lucy Liu of Airwallex:</strong> Lucy Liu is the co-founder of fintech payment platform, Airwallex, a US$4 billion unicorn, which exceed US$100 million in annual revenues in 2021. Mirroring other female founders, L. Liu solved a real-world problem when she co-founded Airwallex in 2016 along with Max Li and Jack Zhang, contributing through her expertise in finance. Airwallex helps customers overcome the issue of dealing with unreasonable bank fees when they import goods from overseas markets. L. Liu serves as an example for women desiring to found their own companies, as she resonates with understanding one’s strengths, working as a team and acknowledging the contribution of all team members in leading the company to success.</li>

                    <p class=" m-0">India has emerged as a global hotbed of startups, next only to the US and the UK. As many as 100 Indian startups have already joined the unicorn club. About 15% of Indian unicorns can boast of having at least one women founder. </p>

                    <br />
                    <p class="m-0">Some of the Indian unicorn companies with at least one female founder include Acko Insurance, BYJU’S, Hasura, Lead School, Livspace, Mamaearth, Mobikwik, Nykaa, OfBusiness, Pristyn Care, Rivigo, The Good Glamm Group and Zenoti. The 100th Indian unicorn, Open has two women founders Deena Jacob and Mabel Chacko of Open. Many of the women founder unicorns operate in the e-commerce industry. Nykaa’s founder Falguni Nayar became the wealthiest Indian women entrepreneur when her beauty ecommerce platform went public in 2022. She also represents the first Indian women to head a publicly listed startup, and since is being widely seen as an inspiration and role model for aspiring women entrepreneurs in India.</p>

                    <p class="m-0">Women participation at entrepreneurship level has been growing over the decade, and has accelerated in the previous couple of years. The Government of India has undertaken various initiatives to encourage women entrepreneurship. Niti Aayog’s Women Entrepreneurship Platform, Stree Shakti Scheme, Mahila Udyam Nidhi Scheme and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana are all government sponsored schemes formed to support women business leaders. Women entrepreneurs can also leverage programs initiated by corporates or governments such as the Indian government. A case in point is the Women Entrepreneurship Platform introduced by the Government of India under NITI Aayog to promote existing and aspiring women entrepreneurs in the country. Then, there are a few Angels/ funds who are consciously working to provide equal opportunities to women to found companies.</p>
