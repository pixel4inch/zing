                      interpretation of reality. Few of technologies that provide the backbone of the AR experience are
                      discussed below. </p>
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                      <li> <strong>Sensors -</strong> Sensor technologies comprise an indispensable component of
                        augmented
                        reality systems
                        owing to their role in providing key inputs to AR devices or platforms. Majority of AR
                        applications focus on audiovisual interfaces and use voice recognition and motion tracking
                        sensors. AR systems are required to understand what a user is seeing or hearing and how the
                        surrounding is changing. This requires sophisticated sensing that relies on IMUs along with heat
                        mapping, time-of-flight sensors and structured light sensors. IMUs for AR systems use gyroscope,
                        magnetometer and accelerometer to correct error and deliver accurate results to help the system
                        in
                        tracking head position and movement. Augmented reality environments also depend on various
                        imaging
                        sensors for presenting digital images of a real environment. Advanced headsets for AR rely on
                        special imaging sensors such as time-of-flight (ToF) cameras, binocular depth sensing,
                        structured-light sensors, and vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL)-based light
                        detection
                        and ranging (LiDAR). ToF cameras are intended to combine modulated IR light source and a charged
                        coupled device image sensor. These sensors measure time-of-flight or phase delay of reflected
                        light for determining the distance between cameras and illuminated object. While structured
                        light
                        sensors are designed to project specific pattern of light onto the surrounding, VCSEL-based
                        LiDAR
                        produces high-fidelity point clouds. The VCSEL technology finds use in wearable devices such as
                        smart glasses for yielding low-power, compact displays as well as gesture recognition systems.
                        Some of the other types of sensors used by AR systems are directional microphones, ambient light
                        sensors, rear- or forward-facing video cameras, and different biosensors like thermal sensors.
                      </li>
                      <li> <strong>Location Tracking -</strong> AR depends on location tracking devices for desired
                        outcomes such as GPS and
                        magnetometers. Magnetometer measures the magnetic field of the Earth to provide AR devices with
                        an
                        orientation regarding the magnetic field. These sensors allow smartphones to find a specific
                        direction for auto-rotation of digital maps in line with physical orientation of the user. These
                        devices are relevant for location-based AR applications. The GPS represents a navigation
                        satellite
                        system intended to offer time and geo-location information to dedicated GPS receiver. These
                        devices also play an important role in enabling location-based AR applications. </li>
                      <li> <strong>Haptics - </strong> Haptics for augmented reality holds a significant relevance for
                        creating tactile
                        effects to uplift the entire AR experience. Design engineers have developed ultrasound-based
                        haptics on the basis of precise control of multiple speakers sending out timed ultrasound
                        pulses.
                        With meticulous time differences, ultrasound pulses from different speakers reach at a specific
                        place concurrently to cause a pressure point, which can be experienced by the user skin. Users
                        can
                        change the focal point of ultrasound waves in real-time on the basis of specific factors like
                        hand
                        position. These platforms also involve the use of tracking camera for gesture recognition as
                        well
                        as offering exact position of the hand to change the focal point. Approaches to control movement
                        of the focal point can result in different tactile effects. In addition, the haptic feedback is
                        anticipated to use AV/VR platforms beyond gaming applications, such as interactions or system
                        controls for vending machines or shopping kiosks, building automation and automotive interiors.
                      </li>
                      <li> <strong>Mobile AR - </strong> The concept of mobile AR revolves around the use of mobile
                        devices like tablets or
                        smartphones for augmented reality. The launch of Apple ARKit in 2017 along with its integration
                        into the iOS platform played an important role in pushing accessibility. The development was
                        followed by Google’s launch of ARCore in the next year to support Android devices. Considering
                        the
                        extensive penetration of mobile devices, mobile AR has emerged as the most popular version of
                        augmented reality. Some of the most successful uses of the concept include AR games such as
                        Pokémon Go, Google’s AR search, face filters and apps dedicated to specific applications. While
                        haptics is yet to find acceptance in the field of mobile AR, there are ongoing efforts that are
                        anticipated to enable the development. </li>

                      <li> <strong>AR Content Creation Tools - </strong> There are several software solutions and online
                        platforms that
                        assist developers in creating the AR content. While options like Google’s ARCore are effective
                        solutions for beginners, Google’s Poly presents an online library that allows users to browse,
                        remix and share 3D assets. These assets represent 3D models or scenes generated using Blocks,
                        Tilt
                        Brush, or 3D programs capable of producing files that may be uploaded to Poly. Some of these
                        assets are available for developers without any charge. Developers can use Tilt Brush for
                        painting
                        in 3D with virtual reality, using elements like 3D brush strokes, fire, stars or light. On the
                        other side, developers can use Blocks to create 3D objects. In addition, cross-platform game
                        engines such as Unity are gaining increasing attention for developing 2D and 3D simulations and
                        video games for mobile devices, game consoles and computers. These platforms are enjoying
                        increasing acceptance among developers for creation of AR content. </li>

                      <li> <strong>Motion Tracking Technologies -</strong> Augmented reality platforms rely on various
                        motion tracking
                        technologies for sensing the user movement. Some of the key technologies used by these platforms
                        include Concurrent Odometry & Mapping (COM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).
                        The
                        former allows smartphones to locate themselves in space in line with their surroundings. The COM
                        technology captures feature points, referred to as visually distinct objects’ features within
                        the
                        environment, including a table edge or light switch. On the other hand, SLAM helps smartphones
                        and
                        robots in understanding and analyzing the surrounding for acting in an appropriate manner. The
                        SLAM process uses different types of sensors such as light sensors, accelerometers, cameras,
                        depth
                        sensors and gyroscopes.

                        navigation. The technology can be exploited to display AR directions in various large-area
                        indoor
                        locations like airports, shopping malls and distribution centers, benefitting both customers and
                        businesses. While guests can use AR indoor navigation for finding desired products in a store,
                        employees in distribution centers can use the technology for locating a specific item within the
                        warehouse. AR indoor navigation also holds potential to improve efficiency of ‘buy online
                        pick-up
                        in store’ (BOPIS) services. AR directions facilitate direct navigation for team members seeking
                        specific items or products for order fulfillment. The approach plays an important role in saving
                        time for employees. </li>

                      <li> <strong>AR to Elevate Shopping Experience - </strong> AR was one of the fortunate
                        technologies
                        that received a
                        major stimulus from the pandemic for elevating the online shopping experience. The scenario
                        resulted in extensive use of virtual try-on solutions. AR technology witnessed broader uptake
                        among brands to take the online shopping experience to the next level. Leading brands are
                        betting
                        heavily on augmented reality technology and associated experiences to help customers in
                        virtually
                        trying products before finalizing the purchasing decision. Some of the major jewelry brands are
                        using AR for enabling customers to personalize specific products on the website using a 3D
                        configurator as well as virtually trying them. While traditional retail stores are witnessing
                        return of the customer in the post-pandemic phase, there are compelling opportunities for the
                        technology to improve the in-store experience. Various stores are using smart mirrors for
                        enhanced
                        experience and reducing the requirement of fitting rooms. These smart mirrors allow customers to
                        try products in-store using sophisticated AR technology. In the coming years, AR is poised to
                        garner more attention in the retail sector for uplifting the shopping experience for customers.

                      <li> <strong>Education to Get More Interactive With AR - </strong> Augmented reality is being
                        increasingly considered
                        as an intriguing technology to overcome various limitations associated with the traditional
                        theory-based education model. AR can enable highly interactive solutions that can boost
                        imagination, understanding and learning. Considering the inclination of children to learn new
                        technology and experiences, AR improves motivation and makes classes more engaging and
                        entertaining. On the other hand, 4D Anatomy enables students to explore a large number of
                        anatomical structures as well as discover numerous dissection specimens related to real anatomy.
                        The approach enhances understanding of the anatomy through manipulation and observation of
                        virtual
                        3D objects from multiple angles. In addition, AR presents a more affordable and accessible
                        option
                        over physical supplies, indicating a promising future of the technology in the field of
                        education
                        in the future.</li>
