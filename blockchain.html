                  <p class=" m-0">In the current pandemic transformed landscape, growth in the blockchain industry will be led by next-generation innovations and the resulting development of new applications areas. Blockchain-based identity management systems are likely to emerge as one of the most notable innovations in the next-generation Blockchain space. The concept holds prominence owing to the need for confirming digital identity in operations such as transferring inventories, execution of electronic medical records, and validating asset ownership. Establishment of core functionality such as activity verification and identity confirmation are also expected to witness rapid implementation as well as pave way for high-level capabilities such as outright asset transfer. Also, Blockchain technologies are also likely to find application in AI technologies that are expected to make the transition from research laboratories to practical applications, thus playing a disruptive role in the real world.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p class=" m-0">For AI, Blockchain technologies are expected to find use for coordination of internal operations and also for enabling interactions with the external world. Other advanced applications of Blockchain that could emerge in years ahead include concepts such as the bio-cryptoeconomy: nanorobotic distributed autonomous corporations (DACs) for the purpose of cell enhancement and repair. The idea relies on using Blockchain to coordinate in-body medical activities of nanorobots, which are extremely small robotic devices that can move through the insides of the human body for assessing and improving health. While nanodevices are likely to take few more years, nanoparticles are already being used in clinical practices for dynamically-controllable drug delivery along with other functions. In the long run, medical nanorobots are expected to be used in pathology resolution as well as health enhancement activities. Several companies are focused on creating Blockchain-based applications, including customized medicine systems, to serve the healthcare sector. </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">As Blockchain is a sophisticated Internet-based functionality to enable secure value transfer, technology and financial service providers are likely to gain significantly from its adoption. Microsoft is working on a Blockchain-based identity system to allow apps, services, products and people to interoperate across organizations, cloud providers and blockchains. On the other hand, IBM is planning to integrate Blockchain into its Watson IoT and AI. In addition, mesh networks of next-generation smart sensors intended for various industrial applications, developed by technology leaders like IBM and Blockchain-focused IoT startups, are expected to support Google’s bio-molecular nanotechnology projects.</p>

                  <br/>
                  <p class="m-0">The technology will continue to extend beyond financial transactions. Prompted by its numerous advantages, National Transport Insurance, an Australia-based truck & transport insurance firm, has already started working on a pilot project to implement blockchain for enabling end-to-end monitoring of beef exports in the country. By maintaining transaction records in immutable ledger, blockchain brings more transparency and prevents malpractices in the supply chain. The technology is gaining attention in the healthcare sector owing to its ability to create patient treatment records and provide physicians with desirable information by presenting the complete information online in a secured manner. The technology enables encrypted secure transactions to present an effective alternative in specific fields like identity management. Blockchain is anticipated to play an important role in fraud detection, trade, insurance policy management, public sector, and provenance and food safety in agriculture. Blockchain is gradually finding acceptance in the field of talent management. The technology is being used by a number of educational institutions to issue blockchain-based certificates to graduates, which can be used by prospective employers to verify authenticity of educational qualifications of an applicant without contacting the institute.</p>

                  <br/>
                  <p>Telecom & Media sector is expected to grow rapidly in the upcoming years. In the media sector, Blockchain technology has potential applications in offering support for low-cost micropayments, which eliminate the processing fees that are commonly associated with existing payment networks. Blockchain’s programmability also makes it possible to implement rights related to usage of creative works. For the telecom industry, Blockchain-based platform can be used for supporting Internet of Things (IoT) applications, with the distributed characteristic of the ledger playing a critical part in promoting coordination between several connected devices. For example, Samsung and IBM have built proof of concept based partly on Ethereum Blockchain, for demonstrating Blockchain framework’s support for IoT applications by favoring transaction processing devices. Also, since Blockchains used cryptographic security, the security challenges facing IoT-related deployments can be reduced significantly. </p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>Among non-finance application markets of Blockchain, the development of alternative retail payment platforms is the most apparent application of the technology in the consumer and industrial product markets. However, other applications of Blockchain for consumer and industrial products segment are still in investigational stage and mostly futuristic. In the transportation sector, Blockchain is being explored for use in simplifying the process of auto purchasing and leasing. For example, DocuSign developed an app for providing proof of concept for Visa’s connected car. Integrating bitcoin Blockchain and capable of recording contracts, the app is aimed at easing the process of auto purchase and leasing. Public sector is also focused on exploring Blockchain technology primarily to improve record keeping in the public sector. For example, the Honduras government partnered with Factor for deploying a Blockchain-based program for recording land ownership. By using a system based on a transparent, distributed ledger, the initiative seeks to reduce corruption and fraud related to government-controlled centralized registry. Among other uses of public sector include digital identities for individuals, vehicle registrations, benefits reimbursements and voting records. </p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>In the healthcare sector, blockchain has potential role in creating secure digital assets. Blockchain technology also has numerous horizontal applications targeting various industries. Few examples of such horizontal applications include smart contracts, automated audits, and improved cyber security. Smart contracts, which refer to agreements capable of automatically activating actions on the basis of certain conditions, have the potential to cut down administrative costs considerably through such self-enforcement. Blockchain technology can also transform the role of corporate audits by enabling third parties to verify distributed network, to ascertain the accuracy of transactions. Blockchain technology also enables cryptographic signatures, whereby it is possible to immediately detect data manipulation and verify IT systems integrity, thus offering Blockchain a critical role to play in the sphere of cyber security.</p>

                    <li>In the banking, financial services and insurance sector, growth is expected to benefit from the
                      growing adoption of blockchain in applications such as digital identities, payments, exchanges and
                      documentation. Blockchain technology also assists in decentralization of data that is critical for
                      securing online payments. Further, automation of transactions and subsequent elimination of
                      documentation due to Blockchain technology results in significant improvements in security.
                      Blockchain also enables real-time tracking of transactions, thus preventing any frauds or errors
                      in online transactions. Owing to the wide range of benefits offered by the technology, the use of
                      Blockchain technology is expected to gain momentum across a range of applications. Further use of
                      Blockchain for government initiatives and establishment of consortiums to promote and explore
                      applications of Blockchain are also expected to drive market growth in the coming years. A growing
                      number of organizations and institutions are deliberating adoption of Blockchain technology, owing
                      to its significant role in reducing transaction cost by accelerating the transaction process by
                      eliminating the need for verification by third party intermediaries. Since the global financial
                      and economic crisis of 2008, the focus of regulatory authorities has been on restructuring the
                      financial services industry to enhance the sector’s resilience. Blockchain FinTech startups have
                      emerged with the potential to transform not just the financial services sector but also
                      non-finance business activities. Realizing the potential of Blockchain technology in transforming
                      business processes by making them more transparent, efficient, secure and autonomous, a number of
                      innovators, entrepreneurs, and established enterprises along with venture capitalists and other
                      investors are seeking to explore this revolutionary technology.</li>
                    <li>The applicability of blockchain will continue to extend beyond financial transactions. Prompted

                      which eliminate the processing fees that are commonly associated with existing payment networks. A
                      case in point is a newspaper’s web operations, which can charge readers on per-article or per-page
                      basis, as against monthly subscriptions/fees. Further, Blockchain is also being positioned as a
                      technology for secure creative digital products and intellectual property such as images and
                      music. Blockchain-based ledgers can be used as a secure and reliable means of providing proof of
                      provenance and attribution for a specific work. The Blockchain’s programmability also makes it
                      possible to implement rights related to usage of creative works. For the telecom industry,

                      cryptographic security, the security challenges facing IoT-related deployments can be reduced
                      significantly. For example Verizon Ventures invested into a startup, which has successfully raised
                      $5 million in funding for initiatives investigating Blockchain-enabled IoT applications. Another
                      telecom company, Orange has also announced investment into a Blockchain startup. Indian operator
                      Jio expanded its role in creation of blockchain ecosystem by launching Jio-GenNext, a startup
                      accelerator, to drive blockchain-related innovations.</li>

                    <li><strong>	Next-Generation Innovations:</strong> In the current pandemic transformed landscape, growth in the market will be led by next-generation blockchain innovations and the resulting development of new applications areas. Blockchain-based identity management systems are likely to emerge as one of the most notable innovations in the next-generation Blockchain space. The concept holds prominence owing to the need for confirming digital identity in operations such as transferring inventories, execution of electronic medical records, and validating asset ownership. Establishment of core functionality such as activity verification and identity confirmation are also expected to witness rapid implementation as well as pave way for high-level capabilities such as outright asset transfer. Also, Blockchain technologies are also likely to find application in AI technologies that are expected to make the transition from research laboratories to practical applications, thus playing a disruptive role in the real world. For AI, Blockchain technologies are expected to find use for coordination of internal operations and also for enabling interactions with the external world. Financial institutions have been spearheading innovations in the Blockchain technology space, with the sector already witness to successful implementations of use cases such as Nasdaq’s private market trading platform and Ripple’s cross border payment platform. Meanwhile a number of central banks in countries such as Russia, Canada and Australia are realizing the importance of digitization, and thus investigating release of digital currencies based on Blockchain technology. The potential benefits of Blockchain are becoming a lure for non-finance sector, with companies looking to develop use cases such as P2P payments, healthcare, identity and authentication, IoT (Internet of Things), and supply chain management. Though most organizations are looking to explore use cases for Blockchain on their own, several others are opting to collaborate with startups holding expertise in Blockchain technology. For example, Visa entered into partnership with a blockchain startup, Chain for exploring money transfer networks that will be based on Blockchain technology. The technology is also finding interest from government agencies and public bodies, with a number of initiatives already commenced based on Blockchain technology for streamlining operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>	Tightening FinTech-Related Government Regulations:</strong> The increasingly stringent regulations being adopted by governments around the world is also expected to impact the blockchain industry in the coming years. Most governments are looking to implement numerous fintech regulations during the next few years. Regulators worldwide are keenly monitoring the growing digitalization of the global economy triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Blockchain, digital banking, and cryptocurrency are likely to be the primary topics of concern. With the growing number of finance transactions being made outside of the traditional mechanisms and institutions, regulators could not afford to ignore issues such as DEFI. Meanwhile, the legislators in the European Union are planning for a region-wide regulatory system for all crypto assets markets. The system would include creation and spread of token investments as a more modern and sophisticated investing vehicle.</li>
                    <li><strong>	Interoperability between Blockchains:</strong> Interoperability is the ability of systems, programs or technologies to act among themselves without any restrictions. Interoperability is important to assure users that exchange of systems is possible, irrespective of the manufacturer. Among the leading companies such as IBM, Accenture, SAP, Microsoft, Fujitsu, Oracle and Microsoft, there is growing emphasis of blockchain interoperability as a key technical innovation, to enable use of blockchains without any barriers. While most blockchains are similar to Bitcoin Blockchain, certain differences have presented impediments to their seamless functioning. With interoperability, it will be possible for blockchain developers to create a basic framework to enable rapid and streamlined processes. Interoperable blockchains will allow seamless transfer of information as well as exchange of data. At present, work is ongoing to achieve standardized blockchain interoperability.</li>
                    <li><strong>	Metaverse:</strong> Metaverse is the latest buzzword that has been capturing the imagination of the tech industry. Simply put, Metaverse is an integration of immersive presence in a virtually interactive self-sufficient ecosystem of mobile networks, augmented reality, social media, gaming, virtual reality, ecommerce, cryptocurrency, and work environments. As the metaverse movement builds momentum, blockchains are slated to don an integral role in ascribing authenticity to electronic transactions, both for fungible and non-fungible tokens. NFTs are emerging as integral to gaming, especially for monetizing user-created content and for secure transactions across the platform. The technology is set to play an important role in the metaverse by supporting interoperability and user privacy. The metaverse is poised to create the need for permission-less identity, high-speed exchange and financial services. The need to store and deliver large data volumes to millions of people points towards the relevance of blockchain, a technology behind cryptocurrency. Various companies including The Sandbox and Decentraland are coming up with virtual worlds intended to integrate cryptocurrencies to help gamers in creating structures such as virtual theme parks or casinos as well as monetizing them. Decentraland uses Mana as currency to allow users make purchases or gamble in virtual casinos. In addition, metaverse is likely to rely on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for enabling people to own specific characters, in-game products and the virtual land.  </li>
                    <li><strong>	Rapid Growth of NFTs:</strong> NFT or non-fungible token is a trending topic. NFTs' key digital assets such as music, pictures, code, and contracts, are stored on a blockchain and NFTs have value because of their uniqueness. NFTs are a new way of generating money for few industrious people such as musician Grimes and the NBA that generate millions using NFTs. Some individuals call NFTs digital collectibles, because, unlike many digital files, NFTs can't be replicated or copied, therefore, NFTs bring the scarcity principle in the digital assets domain for the first time. Digital assets purchase and ownership has become quite common in the last decade and people have invested in thousands in building collections of music, movies, productivity software, books, and videogame. However, nothing people buy is actually personal or unique in the digital world, and most of the time people don't really own the thing they purchase digitally, people simply pay for the license to use the service. NFTs are unique as they offer a way of certification and authentication of the ownership of almost all things intangible or tangible, including unique artworks. NFTs are used to track the ownership of a property or land, which is very time-consuming and are utilized in the search of used vehicles, or registries, where the previous ownership data is found.</li>
                    <li><strong>	Cryptocurrencies:</strong> During the pandemic period, as people adapted to the new normal of cashless transactions due to social distancing, cryptocurrencies gained popularity. However, the cryptocurrency landscape is not without its risks and challenges, which might result from the constant fluctuations in this space. Meme coins such as Dogecoin are also rising in value over the past year. However, it is challenging for the financial services sector and banks to deal with fluctuating cryptocurrency trends, where long-term usefulness and stability are crucial. The stablecoins concept is increasing in popularity, as they offer a relief from the extreme highs and lows of cryptocurrency values. Cryptocurrencies such as TrueUSD, USDCoin, and Tether, try to peg their value with real-world centralized currencies, which means the cryptocurrencies are not as lucrative as speculative investments, which certainly do provide stability essential for the currency utilized as an asset and medium exchange as well. Presently, stablecoins are highly being utilized in parking assets during high volatility by not transferring back to the centralized currencies. Stablecoins in long term, are anticipated to provide real digital currencies' blueprint usable by anyone. While the recent years were a great period for investments in cryptocurrencies, there was also a steady rise in crypto frauds. While global crypto exchanges suffered scams involving high-profile transactions, hacks on DEFI companies represented over 20% of the overall theft volume in 2020. Such crypto frauds are expected to increase through 2023. The various cyber fraud types that could be seen include fraudulent crypto wallet scams, fake crypto investment platforms, crypto-jacking, and new forms of malware that might target lesser-known cryptocurrencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>	Private Blockchains:</strong> An increasing number of blockchain-based projects are expected to switch to production. Besides reflecting the growing maturity of the blockchain technology and a more realistic approach, this trend also indicates the pandemic-induced initiation and acceleration of projects that might bring quantifiable advantage within a short timeframe. About 40% of corporates disclosed at least one blockchain-based pilot project running. Nearly 30% of such projects across the world are anticipated to transition to production, at least partly due to the impact of the pandemic. As a result, most of the networks that evolve from pilot to production would use private enterprise blockchain solutions for this change. In 2022 and beyond, private blockchain platforms are expected to become key contributors to the global blockchain market growth. Enterprise blockchain platforms are often customized according to the business needs of corporates, and provide the corporates with more opportunities in terms of using the blockchain technology for use cases involving business-to-business transactions. Private enterprise blockchain solutions deliver greater reliability, as well as higher transparency, efficiency, and privacy, while security is provided by means of ensuring that private keys are available only to authorized persons within the organization.</li>
                    <li><strong>	Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP):</strong> Another important trend expected to emerge is Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Blockchain-based ZKPs enable the different record-keeping systems of companies to be “in sync” and verifiable on a record-by-record basis without the risk of sharing sensitive information. The need for ZKPs is critical now to meet challenges associated with maintaining confidentiality. Currently, these challenges are holding back blockchain projects to a certain extent. However, recently, much progress around ZKPs is being seen, and there are increasing number of solutions available in the market for wider deployment of ZKPs. For example, ZKPs are being used as a sort of notary when mortgage requests are put on blockchain, allowing automatic acceptance or rejection of such a request. Nevertheless, the complexity of development of ZKPs still remains a big challenge. Development of ZKPs is a lot more complex than coding a smart contract sans privacy, though corporates would mostly opt for developing ZApps rather than developing DApps, mainly for security reasons.</li>
                    <li><strong>	DLT-offerings by Non-Traditional Financial Institutions:</strong> Increase in the number of non-traditional financial institutions would be another major trend triggered by the pandemic in the coming years. They would be the result of a growing number of consumers as well as corporates turning more towards the mode of blockchain-based online financial services and transactions. Currently, these are delivered more through non-bank options offered by institutions including non-bank lenders, crypto currency-based banks, and alternatives such as fully decentralized financial (DeFi) services.</li>
                    <li><strong>	DeFi to Emerge as an Alternative:</strong> Besides the expected acceleration in the adoption of tokenization, which is digital storage of assets on blockchain, decentralized financial services (DEFI) would be another key trend for the industry. A study of the working of DeFi shows the potential use of blockchain for financial use cases. DeFi exemplifies a successful process for implementing smart contracts in the financial services space, though this remained the major aspect missing in enterprise blockchain offerings. As such, this alternative form of financing could fit perfectly into the fintechization of the future global economy. The strong growth of DEFI services, which was already seen in 2020 with the total value of cryptocurrency-based fully decentralized financial services, is likely to accelerate further in 2021 and beyond.</li>
                    <li><strong>	CBDC Projects:</strong> Currently, around 80% of central banks across the world are focused on studying the pros and cons of central bank digital currency (CBDC). This process would intensify further in 2021, driven by COVID-19-induced factors such as the digitalization of the economy, diminishing use of cash, and the emergence of private digital currencies such as Libra. China is seeking to play a pioneering role in the central bank money or CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies). China has already launched a digital e-yuán, which is centrally controlled by the government, but is not in the truest sense of decentralized blockchain technology. China has already conducted multiple experiments involving corporates and citizens, and is almost ready for a global roll-out. Europe, which until now has been adopting a cautious approach to CBDCs, is witnessing a change in strategy with a private sector entity in the region launching its own digital money. The use of digital money is subject to the fact that it must be controlled by central bank or with financial authorities or the state. The need for a centrally managed digital Euro for instance is likely to present opportunities for Blockchain implementations.</li>
