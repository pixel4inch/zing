                  <p class=" m-0">Cryptocurrency startups worldwide are making active efforts to develop easy ways of using, buying and trading digital currencies, which will be vital for enhancing customer awareness and hence drive wider adoption. Most of the adoption is attributed to less important applications such as meme coins, which are assets based on jokes but do not have any real value other than offered by social indicators. These applications however are detrimental since they reinforce the view that cryptocurrencies are not legitimate. The adoption of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) is one among the factors that is driving considerable growth in the cryptocurrencies market over the past year. NFTs are becoming accessible to retail investors, with involvement of sports entities in sale of digital clips and cards also presenting opportunities for the market. At present, retail investors are generally the most common cryptocurrency investor base, while leading financial institutions are still in discovery stages. However, new companies are emerging with plans for cryptocurrencies, while banks are also facing pressure from crypto investors to get involved in the industry. This is mainly because of the growing importance of crypto funds as an asset class. Though at present there is no use case, the advent of large institutional investors will ensure price stability, improve cryptocurrency legitimacy and hence drive mainstream adoption.</p>

                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Many industrial investors are preferring cryptocurrencies as a safe haven against inflation that the traditional economy might pose. Even banks that previously refused to consider cryptocurrencies are now establishing outlets providing their clients with cryptocurrency services. In today’s world, many of the regions lack basic infrastructure required for banking services essential to allow people to build savings or get loans. This could lead to perilous lending practices charging high rates of interest. In such places, finances could become more stable with the use of cryptocurrency. The high volatility and ease-of-use of cryptocurrency presents the less privileged communities with many opportunities to build wealth. Platforms and apps such as CoinSwitch Kuber make crypto transactions very simple, especially for the people in rural areas, bringing them on par with transactions on a broader level. In addition, the cryptocurrency’s decentralized nature allows low-cost transactions across borders. This type of revolution in a country’s financial system could leave the citizens more connected and empowered. Cryptocurrency proved its resilience during what could be termed the worst crisis of the century. As the COVID-19 crisis starts fading, crypto, as a new payment system and an asset class, could bring a transformation in the global financial landscape. </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Since 2021, the regulatory landscape for the cryptocurrency market has been witness to considerable changes. One of the notable regulations in the year has been the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced in May 2021, whereby transfers exceeding $10,000 will need to be reported to IRS, in order to curb tax evasion. The regulations will also reduce instances of scams or malicious use cases, presenting a favorable opportunity for mainstream adoption. In several emerging markets, there are ongoing efforts to integrate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into economies. Costa Rica, for example, announced legalization of paying employees in cryptocurrencies. This resulted in high adoption of cryptocurrencies in the country. The Philippines is another country supporting the cause of cryptocurrencies. </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">The mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency is facing its biggest challenge from the price volatility. Bitcoin in particularly has been volatile over the recent years. Given the expensive transaction fees involved, use of Bitcoin for processing transactions is not considered sustainable for the long term. In comparison other cryptocurrencies are not volatile since community that invests in these currencies have reached a consensus on the pricing. Regulations are expected to address price volatility issue with time. Given the nascent stage of the industry, the prices remain volatile. Further, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are yet to gain acceptance as payment mode, and are not viable for faster processing of transactions </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Institutional Investors Continue to Pour in Funds into Cryptocurrency Market:</strong>
                      In the early days of evolution, bitcoin was disregarded by institutions as being a worthless
                      digital asset that is mostly a preferred currency for criminals. Over the years, however, the
                      perception has undergone a dramatic change, with Bitcoin now on the verge of institutional
                      acceptance. This change is mainly attributed to a number of reasons, in particular the rapid
                      growth of bitcoin compared to other asset class. As a result, bitcoin is becoming part of
                      portfolio diversification strategies. The sentiment is also improving due to the increase in
                      involvement by corporates and fund managers. Though the number of individual investors is on the
                      decline, there has been unprecedented interest among institutional investors. Since trading
                      volumes are significantly higher in the case of institutional investors compared to many
                      individual investors, the market remains sustainable despite fewer transactions by trading
                      partners in digital currencies. </li>
                    <li><strong>Central Banks Move into Digital Currency Space:</strong> Several central banks across
                      the world have launched or plan to launch their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) after
                      assessing all their drawbacks and benefits. The Central Bank Group, consisting of the European
                      Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Swiss National Bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, the Bank of
                      England and The Bank of Canada, are working in tandem to assess the use of CBDCs, encompassing
                      technical, economic and functional design choices as well as cross-border interoperability. Unlike
                      cryptocurrencies, CBDCs would be a digitized form of the currency of a country, designed, backed,
                      and issued by the country’s financial authorities. China leads in introducing such digital
                      currency and digital Yuan is currently under the process of trialing. The introduction of CBDCs
                      (Central Bank Digital Currencies) together with emerging regulations is anticipated to encourage
                      the central banks to be part of the cryptocurrency game. </li>
                    <li><strong>Crypto-based DeFi Applications Rise in Prominence:</strong> DeFi (Decentralized
                      financial) services are anticipated to be the biggest trend in the cryptocurrency world.
                      Decentralized finance ensures availability of financial goods to all on a decentralized public
                      blockchain network rather than intermediaries such as brokers and banks. Unlike a brokerage or
                      bank account, no address proof or government issued ID is required in DeFi. Borrowers, lenders,
                      sellers and buyers engage with one another via a rigorous software instead of a fintech app
                      development agency or transaction-facilitating corporation. DeFi platforms and applications are
                      replacing the conventional financial systems with new and innovative trading methods using digital
                      currencies. The entire financial system has the potential to be revolutionized through
                      structuring, borrowing, and lending of derivative products, as well as selling and purchasing of
                      securities via a decentralized open-source network. Majority of DeFi contracts feature
                      stablecoins. DeFi is being used in decentralized exchanges acting as peer-to-peer exchanges, loan
                      contracts wherein interest rates are algorithmically calculated on the basis of demand and supply,
                      asset management protocols designed for automates robo-advisory, as well as an array of solutions
                      employed in insurance and finance. DeFi projects built a powerful foundation for the field of
                      finance recently and DeFi is anticipated to be the major driver for the rapid adoption of
                      tokenization or digital assets' storage. Additionally, the growth of Ethereum, which is based on
                      the DeFi protocols, is estimated to drive the demand for DeFi. While DeFi can resolve complex
                      needs related to digital ID for businesses and also facilitates access to financial performance
                      track records during transaction banking, there is however lack of critical elements such as
                      one-to-one exchange with fiat currency as well as interoperability between different blockchains.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>NFTs to Emerge as the Major Crypto Trend in the Future:</strong> Non-fungible tokens
                      (NFTs) are digital assets that represent items existing in both real and virtual worlds. Usually,
                      such assets are tracked using a blockchain such as Ethereum. Instead of a centralized platform,
                      items could be traded on a decentralized exchange through protocols. The art and gaming industries
                      are witnessing significant growth in the usage of NFTs. The whole NFT concept began started with
                      digital cat artwork Cryptokitties, and is now globally recognized, with the involvement of many
                      legacy brands. Over the first few days after the launch, ETH worth more than $1 million was spent
                      by people on digital feline artwork. With this instant popularity, this app became the first to
                      create congestion on the Ethereum blockchain, and drew the attention of mainstream media outlets
                      such as the BBC and Bloomberg. Cryptokitties was the first app to use the ERC721 token standard
                      that allows development of non-fungible tokens (NFTs.) The combination of NFTs with DeFi takes the
                      idea further and offers the potential to connect DeFi to many other assets, including the assets
                      in the real world. </li>
                    <li><strong>Emergence of Exchange-Traded Products:</strong> Traditional (non-trust) ETPs
                      (exchange-traded products) are also witnessing significant investment inflows. In countries Europe
                      and Canada, ETPs are attracting significant investments from parties looking to gain crypto
                      exposure without having to deal with challenges related to management of assets custody. The
                      impeding approval for first spot Bitcoin ETF in the US will ensure greater direct exposure to
                      investors. </li>
                    <li><strong>The Stablecoin Opportunity:</strong> As digital tokens tied to fiat currencies,
                      stablecoins hedge against a possible fall in the price valuation of the underlying collateral.
                      This may be the reason why stablecoins are pegged to be the biggest opportunity in the crypto
                      market. Investors are investing in stablecoins to safeguard themselves against the general
                      cryptocurrency market volatility. Stablecoins are likely to register growth owing to two major
                      factors including long-term volatility of decentralized tokens along with the decline of Tether,
                      the largest stablecoin in the market. Among the first stablecoins available to mainstream
                      investors, Tether or USDT has endured many well-known growing pains as the sub-industry expanded.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Blockchain Set to be the Next big Crypto Trend:</strong> Blockchain refers to a digital
                      ledger, which is decentralized and could be used to record transactions and data. Among the
                      primary uses of blockchain are management and storage of digital currencies such as Ethereum and
                      bitcoin, which are forms of virtual cash that are operated independently of the respective state
                      governments. Though forecasting the next trend is not easy, the next wave is expected to be in
                      consumer products, which could make digital currencies increasingly accessible in everyday life.
                      As digital currencies are used more widely, the number of blockchain wallet users is expected to
                      increase to 200 million by 2030. The upcoming years would be focused on creating consumer-oriented
                      crypto products, and crypto education would also emerge as another big area for people to explore.
                      Currently, mainstream adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies is in the nascent
                      stage. </li>
