                      presents a space race feature to turn quizzes into competitive games. In addition, various
                      institutions are looking forward to implement Knowre for adding gaming mechanics to mathematics.
                      These tools and platforms are anticipated to drive the popularity of gamification for education.

                    <li><strong>IoT -</strong> As more educational institutions introduce digital technology as a part of their set-up,
                      they would need more of digitally native infrastructure that could accelerate the use of IoT
                      devices. A case in point is smartphones, which have become integral to the online education sector
                      and a vital means for online learning. Some other potential IoT solutions with promising outlook
                      in the educational technology space include wearables for student monitoring and attendance
                      tracking and smart boards for interactive digital classrooms. There are many institutions who are
                      using IoT for monitoring air quality, monitoring on-campus activity and/or ensuring safety of
                      premises, staff and students.</li>

                    <li><strong>Focus on Cybersecurity Grows Stronger -</strong> With big data, analytics and cloud storage in play, the
                      risk of data theft or hacking has increased manifold, necessitating educational institutions
                      upgrade their data security measures. Safeguarding student data, including their names, date of
                      birth, phone numbers and email addresses against cybercrimes is important, and so is to protect
                      students from cyberbullying (bullying through electronic means). Cybersecurity ensures student
                      data is protected with high level of security, and the trend is only expected to gain traction
                      with an increasing number of educational institutions realizing the value of cybersecurity if they
                      are to adopt educational technology. The most used Blockchain features when integrated into
                      e-learning platforms are file verification mechanisms, ID authentication, and tokenized mechanisms
                      for increased affordability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborative & Out of Class Learning Makes Headway - </strong>The adoption of educational technology has
                      opened up the possibility of collaborative learning for one and all irrespective of where they are
                      based in the world. Information and communication technology has heralded a new era of e-learning
                      where collaborative features allow students to share and discuss, which further helps them improve
                      their interpersonal skills. Unlike the traditional educational approaches that centered on
                      in-class teaching and learning, the advent and proliferation of mobile digital devices has taken
                      learning beyond the boundaries of a physical classroom. The pandemic has further made e-learning
                      or m-learning popular, and the trend in most likelihood would continue due to the convenience of
                      delivering and receiving education. With complete access to tools including eBooks, bookmarks,
                      search tools, annotation tools, hyperlinks, dictionary and many more, learning becomes interactive
                      and flexible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media based Learning Emerges Into a New Trend - </strong>Social media has seeped into the life of
                      every individual with access to internet, including children. With many children aged 10 to 11
                      years having online social presence on various platforms, many schools and teachers have been
                      proactive in leveraging this trend and turning social media into a powerful tool for augmenting
                      the learning experiences of their students. Educational institutions are increasingly viewing and
                      using social media as a tool to communicate with students where teachers, students and peers can
                      interact, share study materials, projects and opinions. As this platform continues to benefit
                      people of all generations, the trend for social media-based learning is only expected to grow
                      stronger in the coming years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Classroom Learning Gains in Popularity -</strong> Educational technology had first made its
                      way into the classrooms, and since has evolved and grown by leaps and bound. As its classroom
                      journey continues, interactive and lively classrooms continue to benefit millions of students.
                      Interactive classroom learning is primarily based on use of eBooks, which deliver the course
                      material in the form of augmented reality, audio files and videos. An example of the successful
                      implementation of educational technology is the flipped classroom model where students complete
                      learning at home and perform practical work at their school. This form of learning has rendered
                      traditional teaching models obsolete and increased teacher and student interaction over
                      activities, projects, home works, creating a lively interactive environment for learning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bite Size Learning or Microlearning Becomes the New Flavor of Education - </strong>Bite-sized
                      learning/Microlearning provides short but focused learning modules to the target audience whenever
                      and wherever they need it. Modern learners prefer bite-sized learning as it is more mobile
                      friendly. The modules in bite-sized e-learning are small and self-contained. They usually range of
                      1 - 15 minutes of duration, in contrast to traditional e-learning modules that may last for 30 â€“
                      60 minutes. Learners can retain information more easily if it is broken into small chunks and can
                      revisit it whenever required. Microlearning can also be highly beneficial in skill development and
                      offers on-the-job support. Learning in the flow of work refers to learning on-the-job, fast, and
                      with the help of existing tools. However, there have been technical challenges that need to be
                      overcome to improve corporate learning. Almost all the industries have now been turning into APIs
                      so that other can use their services. The use of APIs has been growing in corporate training in
                      microlearning through daily-use tools. With this, learning gets embedded in apps that people use
                      on a daily basis. Learning in the flow of work can be taken to the next level with the following
                      ideas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Art Education Goes Digital - </strong>Over the years art students have come to use a number of digital
                      tools for creatively expressing themselves and the trend had gained even more traction amid the
                      pandemic. Prior to the pandemic students used Cinema 4D and Adobe Creative Cloud and such other
                      tools, at their school campuses, for building realistic models of everything from iconic homes to
                      favorite meals. Amid the pandemic students could not access such technology. However, despite that
                      they could make the most of Autodesk Tinkercad and such other browser based programs on their
                      personal Chromebooks for continuing to express their creativity. Arts education is no longer about
                      learning to sculpt, draw or paint. Modern art classes offer students traditional foundation and
                      additionally train them on technologies for creating masterpieces as they might using the regular
                      brushes, pencils or paper. Use of technology by art students was accelerating even before the
                      pandemic. While schools in other areas were forced to transition their regular activities done in
                      classroom to online, in the world of arts, instructors and students were already up to speed with
                      many digital technologies. Technologies give art students much freedom for being creative.
                      Illustration or drawing aps like Procreate, Do Ink or FlipaClip end all the limiting beliefs in
                      students. A few go-to technologies for art teaching and learning are Adobe Creative Cloud, Do Ink,
                      Soundtrap, Adobe Spark, ArtStudio and Seesaw among others. Adobe Creative Cloud is made up of over
                      twenty mobile and desktop apps and includes most of the tools used by professionals. </li>
                    <li><strong>Edutainment to Revolutionize Knowledge Assimilation -</strong> Education is opening doors to newer ways
                      of exploring and assimilating the concepts using gamifying and simulated learning environments and
                      integrating artificial intelligence and virtual reality to enhance the experiential learning. The
                      onus of teaching is evolving from thrusting abstract bookish concepts to living the experience
                      through hands on learning and simulation. Using virtual reality and simulation renders learning
                      scenarios authentic and fosters life skills such as critical thinking, team work, time management,
                      situational response and task orientation in students. Artificial Intelligence, augmented and
                      virtual reality are making rapid strides into education sector to enhance the student engagement
                      factor and make learning meaningful by tailoring the content to individual needs using a gamut of
                      specialized tools based on the data. Block chain is being explored to enable closure of learning
                      gaps and promoting better learning outcomes to all students being mindful of their specific
                      requirements. Internet of Things is another emerging technology actively being pursued by
                      educators to enhance focused interaction with parents.
                    <li><strong>Mobile Learning to Become Mainstream -</strong> Mobile learning has emerged in K-12 environments and IT
                      leaders are leveraging technology for enhanced flexibility. Device portability has facilitated the
                      new learning environment. Students need devices whether theyâ€™re studying from home or class.
                      Charging carts and asset tagging technologies make organizing easier for teachers, students and IT
                      staff. There is increasing awareness amongst educators that there is more to education than
                      conventional classrooms. This may involve working in groups outside of school, the library or even
                      a different part of the school where technology is required to move with the students and a
                      physical environment may not be the best for the skill sets they want to acquire. The pandemic
                      drove home this point and portability became a necessity for learning which will gain more
                      traction in future. Teachers and students are slowly adapting to the digital reality and devices
                      are becoming the new classroom. Device portability is becoming a necessity with the virus variants
                      threatening to emerge. Portable educational technology is here to stay as students below twelve
                      cannot get vaccinated and will have to depend on devices. A robust approach to device portability
                      has many key social and educational benefits. Mobility takes education outside the classroom
                      increasing learning opportunities. Along with robust Internet connections, portability can present
                      immense possibilities. </li>
                    <li><strong>5G to Emerge as Game Changer for Online Learning -</strong> The next-generation (5G) network is expected
                      to make video conferencing more accessible to wider audience. 5G offers the ability to access
                      simultaneous connections and bigger multi-user experience. The network is expected to bring in
                      more subscription services. 5G mobile data networks will remain expensive and operational only in
                      certain areas and major cities till 2021. However, an improvement in coverage and affordability in
                      data plans is anticipated in later years, and businesses and homes are expected to prefer 5G in
                      the future, over wired networks. The second half of 2019 witnessed an increasing number of service
                      providers switch to 5G as more 5G devices became available. Online learning is slated to receive a
                      significant boost from increasing penetration of 4G and 5G technologies in developing and
                      developed countries. However, the evolution to next-generation 5G networks is expected to be
                      somewhat delayed due to the novel virus outbreak. Ultimately, however, there would be pent-up
                      demand from firms for 5G networks in order to gain an edge. 5G smartphones launch from companies
                      would also be delayed.</li>
