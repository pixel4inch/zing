                  <p>Marketing Technology (Martech) has become an integral part of digital marketing campaigns in recent times, enabling marketing efforts to be optimized across various marketing channels. Marketing automation has evolved to be one of the core requirements of a marketing department – be it a small business enterprise or a large one. In the coming years, marketing tech is expected to evolve and become vital for marketing campaigns. Amidst shrinking marketing budgets, the role of martech continues to gain importance. The advent of new technologies like AI, predictive analytics and blockchain will contribute to widening application base of martech in the coming years.</p>
                
                  <p>Some of the prominent Martech applications include – </p>
                  <p>Customer Data Platform (CDP) - CDP is designed to gather customer data from different sources. The data is normalized and then utilized to build a unified database of customers. The system, thus, helps in creating profiles of each customer that can be shared across other martech systems. CDP is being rapidly adopted by B2B marketers as the platform is capable of handling huge volume of data while delivering personalized experiences to customers. For example, Real-time CDP from Adobe added new features targeting B2B brands with pre-built connector to the company’s B2B marketing automation platform – Marketo Engage. Another example is D&B Lattice CDP of Dun Bradstreet that is primarily focused on B2B marketing. However, rapid adoption of CDP platforms may hinder the popularity of marketing automation platforms as both have some of their functionalities and tools similar to each other. But CDS needs integration with marketing automation platforms as these platforms perform tasks that other systems are unable to perform.</p>
                  <p>Marketing Performance Management (MPM) - MPM platform helps marketing firms evaluate the performance of their marketing campaigns using ML and statistical modeling, such that the firms can understand which of their campaigns are helping them achieve a measurable ROI. The data further help the firms to decide on where to allocate their marketing funds in future so as to be in line with their business goals.</p>
                  <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO): SEO platform offers facilities such as keyword research, rank-checking, backlink analysis, social signal integration, workflow rights, and competitive intelligence, among others.</p>
                  <p>Customer Journey Analytics: The application enables marketers to understand customer journey using real-time data collected from different channels, systems, and touchpoints.</p>
                  <p>Enterprise-Level Platforms: These platforms offer extensive link, site analytics and predictive scoring which help in identifying potential opportunities to improve link authority or page performance. Vendors differentiate themselves by providing more frequent updates, or detailed data, or better features for content marketing that requires additional investments.

                    Identity Resolution Platforms: Such platforms provide a holistic and detailed view of a firm’s customer channels and touchpoints. The identifiers encompass both offline and online attributes and data signals.
                    </p>
                    <p>E-mail Marketing Platforms: Apart from creating and sending e-mail, these platforms also facilitate message designing and creation, automation and collaboration of workflow, previewing message, deliverability management, e-commerce functions, data management, analytics, automation and landing pages, and third-party integrations.</p>
                    <p>Digital Asset Management (DAM): DAM software store and organize a firm’s library of digital marketing assets such that these can be put to use when required. The library comprises media assets related to the brand, such as PDFs, images, video, audio, and virtual reality, among others.</p>
                    <p>Digital Experience Platform (DXP): DXP assists in creating, managing, delivering, and optimizing digital experiences in different contexts and channels. Unlike CMS, the platform delivers to a number of digital channels.</p>
                    <p>Call Analytics Platform: The application can track both offline and online leads. It enables following a call from source, such as display ad, or website, to sales that is based on product line or geographic location.</p>
                    <p>Account-Based Marketing (ABM):  ABM software helps in implementing B2B marketing strategies that complement the marketing efforts and sales on high-value accounts. The software is used to focus on targeted accounts through advertising, content syndication, and direct mail, among others. </p>
                    <p>Digital Events Platform: Digital events platforms help marketers plan, deliver, as well as measure the results of presentations done on-demand, or of digital events conducted for live audiences from different geography.</p>

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Key Technologies used in Martech</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="mb-3"><strong>Artificial Intelligence -</strong> In the past few years, an increasing number of Market Technology (MarTech) companies have started to enhance their platforms using AI. However, AI deployment in the marketing industry has remained extremely limited. AI has not been utilized in several areas of marketing to usher significant transformation. Notwithstanding the limited deployment, there is a growing realization of the huge potential of AI in the MarTech sector due to the faster evolution of AI in campaign optimization, customer segmentation, and intelligent text generation. Thus, AI  technology is expected to become an indispensable aspect of marketing operations in the upcoming years. Several areas in marketing are anticipated to witness exceptional improvements and growth with the use of AI technology. 
                        The AI-based tools can assist marketers quickly creating written materials such as general website content, marketing copy, and sales emails. AI content creation tools are witnessing a considerable demand from marketers who remain under severe pressure to quickly create campaigns. Marketers using AI to generate content reports can create campaigns at a substantially faster rate compared to marketers who are not using AI. AI can effectively manage daily aspects of campaigns such as analyzing metrics and budget monitoring, which can allow marketers to focus on other non-tedious urgent priorities such as identifying ways to attract a large customer base.
                        </li>

                        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Predictive Analytics  - </strong>Almost all marketing automation platforms offer a standard set of analytics that can track quantifiable data such as pages viewed, website visitor activity, time spent on the site, content downloaded, campaign responses, and emails opened. A rising number of vendors are offering predictive models and analytics based on ML, which utilizes algorithms to process insights and data that allow marketers to customize marketing campaigns and visitor experiences. Multiple platforms have invested in AI to utilize the technology for mimicking human intelligence and recommending marketing outcomes or actions, including highly personalized product recommendations or website content based on analysis of firmographics, CRM data, on-site behavior, and consumption trends. Other vendors depend on plug-and-play integration with predictive analytics tools for offering greater personalization and analytics capabilities.</li>
                        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Blockchain - </strong>Blockchain, the latest technology that has demonstrated a significant impact in several industries, can also play a critical role in marketing. The rapid evolution of blockchain can substantially transform the existing nature of marketing. Blockchain is primarily referred to as a distributed database that allows transparent, tamper-proof, and secure transactions. Thus, the technology can allow tracking and verification of marketing campaigns in real time, which can increase transparency and eliminate fraud. Moreover, blockchain can create new targeted marketing opportunities by giving back the value of data to consumers. For instance, brands can offer rewards to their customers to complete certain tasks or share data, which can create a more engaging and interactive experience for customers and provide valuable data to marketers. </li>

                  <ul>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong> Form Building -</strong> Big data is increasingly becoming crucial for businesses. However, the old data collection ways have to be changed due to the implementation of privacy laws across the world. Thus, businesses have to be more proactive in collecting intel through different practices. For instance, form building can enable businesses to obtain information from their customers that can influence the next service or product launched by the business.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Email Marketing - </strong> Presently, email marketing is considered one of the most effective marketing methods, with a substantial share of marketers primarily using email marketing to generate leads. The trend is expected to continue in the upcoming year. Email marketing is highly accessible for businesses and brands for connecting with their customers as almost everyone currently has an email account. Existing customers and individuals who have signed up and yet to purchase any product can be reached by businesses using email subscriber lists during product launches. Product launch emails can help small businesses significantly increase their profit margins.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Marketing Apps  - </strong> Several tools and applications can help marketers to incorporate creativity into their marketing operations. Creativity is expected to become significant in marketing in the upcoming year as creative marketing has a significantly higher chance to get engaged and noticed in the era of stiff competition, where marketers have to compete with a huge amount of available content. SurveyMonkey is the most suitable example of using creativity through email marketing. Marketers can also use several alternatives of SurveyMonkey after comparing the platforms and their pricing. Several businesses that have relied on traditional practices are required to adopt creative marketing methods. They can make their marketing more creative through social media or other platforms, such as Facebook Live.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Real-time Messaging Platforms - </strong> Real-time messaging platforms provide businesses with several marketing teams an exceptional opportunity to reach customers directly and quickly for several purposes, including data collection. Mature real-time messaging platforms can enable digital marketers to effectively utilize customer data. These platforms can also become a data hub storing everything that is required by digital marketers to understand their customers more thoroughly.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Influencer Marketing - </strong> Influencer marketing is expected to witness growth in the upcoming year as this type of marketing generates a substantially higher return on investment. Thus, influencer marketing is currently used by nearly all digital businesses. The influence of certain influencers generates a significantly high return on investment through YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram. However, businesses have to carefully identify the type of influencers required for their brands as selecting the wrong influencers with no relevant audience will not yield the expected results.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Instant Gratification - </strong> In a digital world, instant gratification is necessary as customers exert more power in this medium. Customers prefer to obtain the product or service instantly when they are shopping online. Delays can lead to the loss of a customer for the brands. Thus, the marketing team has to think proactively in place to simply react to customer queries. For instance, the marketing team can develop a knowledge base that can be accessed by customers to get answers to their queries which are preventing them from buying the product.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Outsourcing Digital Marketing Initiatives - </strong> Outsourcing digital marketing initiatives to digital marketing agencies is an effective approach for both big and small businesses to generate higher returns from marketing. Businesses, specifically small businesses, and startups, lacking sufficient in-house resources for marketing can outsource their marketing to digital marketing agencies, which can help them to make big moves in the industry in place of making slow progress within a few years. Moreover, digital marketing agencies have significantly more knowledge to implement and share with growing trends in the digital environment.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Prevalence of Chatbots - </strong> Chatbots have become crucial for marketers and as another investment source. They assist businesses that are not operating 24/7 to engage with customers, answer their queries, and assist them after working hours. Several websites are incorporating chatbots in their business as these chatbots are currently the fastest-growing brand communication channel.</li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><strong>Emergence of Machine Translation - </strong> Multilingual content creation is rising with the accessibility and rapid development of machine translation as most of the non-native English users utilize online translation tools that can misbrand and mistranslate the content. However, overdependence on machine translation can lead to similar errors as online translation tools. Thus, machine translation post-editing is becoming popular with digital marketers as the technology merges native translator skills and advanced technology to generate multilingual content that precisely conveys marketing messages without making marketing blunders.</li>
