                      grow amid the rising complexities of trial designs, patient engagement and simmered down drug
                      approvals for specific therapies following the Pandemic as the regulators have shifting
                      priorities. Organizations are engaging CROs to execute customized or hybrid clinical trials
                      including diverse respondent groups across the world, managing data and reporting findings,
                      thereby, focusing on drug discovery and development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to Shape the US Biotech Industry:</strong> The industry is
                      expected to be also shaped by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that provides Medicare with the
                      right to negotiate drug prices on select small and large molecules after nine and 13 years,
                      respectively. The bill allows drug companies to maintain high prices for large molecules or
                      biologics for four more years than for small molecules. The move is likely to shift the attention
                      from small molecules towards large molecules, prompting some of the players to cull programs
                      dedicated to the former.</li>
