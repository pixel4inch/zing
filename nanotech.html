Initial efforts primarily revolved around use of the technology in the area of food packaging but swift progress is being witnessed in the area of nanoparticles and nanoencapsulation techniques to deliver required bioactive compounds to intended areas of the body.  One of the major applications of nanotechnology within the food sector comprises food processing that is usually carried out for the development of nano-textured/nano-structured food products including ice creams, mayonnaises, yoghurts and creams. Nano-texturing of food materials is known to provide improved texture, stability and consistency of emulsions and enhanced taste in comparison to other forms of normal processed food products. In addition, nano-textured food products are also considered amongst the healthiest forms especially due to their low-fat content. Nano-encapsulated food additives are growing in popularity in more areas than nano-textured or nano-structured food stuffs that predominantly assist in enhancing textures, stability and consistency of emulsions. Nano-encapsulated food additives feature higher surface area when compared to conventional forms and thereby aid in imparting better flavors and tastes. Several forms of nano-sized additives are available in the market across various sectors such as food, nutraceutical and food supplement sectors in the form of antioxidants, vitamins, antimicrobials and minerals.
