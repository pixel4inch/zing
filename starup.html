                    past decade, the global average of Series A rounds has witnessed a threefold increase to over US$18
                    million. Tech companies have grown 2.3 times more than non-tech companies since the pandemic. North
                    America, which has been continuously experiencing a decline in funding share since 2016, accounted
                    for less than half of the early-stage funding raised in 2021, allowing Asia and Europe to make up
                    the majority of the total funding. Meanwhile, the venture capital investments in Latin American
                    startups saw a twofold increase from figures in 2021. In 2021, record levels of venture funding were
                    raised by North American startups at US$329.5 billion and Asian startups at US$165 billion. Latin
                    America was the fastest-growing region in the world in 2021, with investors pouring in an estimated
                    US$19.5 billion into the region. Startup funding in Australia more than tripled in size in 2021,
                    while startups in Africa raised US$4.8 billion from investors during the year, which is 2.5 times
                    more than the year before. In the MENA region, Egyptâ€™s startups particularly stood out, witnessing a
                    year-on-year growth of 155% in venture capital funding rounds and a 60% increase compared to 2017.
                    In 2021, unicorn status was achieved by a record 540 firms, up from 150 firms in 2020, with 110
                    ecosystems churning out at least one US$1 billion-plus behemoth. Meanwhile, 19 ecosystems, including
                    Ho Chi Minh City, Santiago-Valparaiso, Luxembourg, Brisbane, saw unicorns emerge for the first time
                    in 2021. The number of unicorns in North America increased more than three times from 83 in 2020 to
                    310 in 2021. Africa, on the other hand, created three new unicorns, which were all Fintech startups.

                  <p class=" m-0">Over the years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies
                    have achieved remarkable success in transforming a wide range of industries and domains, including
                    biotech and healthcare, transportation, entertainment, energy, education, automotive, real estate,
                    urban management, legal and fraud detection and compliance, communication, sales and marketing,
                    defense and security, ecommerce, and human resources. With AI and ML technologies beginning to
                    increasingly make impressions on various fields, it is creating tremendous opportunities for
                    companies to invest in startups that are engaged in using these technologies. One key sector where
                    startups are particularly focusing on integrating AI and ML technologies is healthcare. In the
                    healthcare industry, AI technology has already been implemented for chatbots and virtual assistance,
                    which is expected to borne positive growth over the next few years. AI and ML startups are currently
                    focusing primarily on other areas of healthcare, including fitness wearables, drug discovery, image
                    analysis, robotic surgery, diagnosis, and monitoring of chronic conditions. AI and ML technologies
                    also hold tremendous potential in transforming the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI)
                    sector in the near future. In the current digital world, the emergence of AI and ML technologies has
                    been creating new opportunities for enhancing the scope of BFSI offerings. Several startups have
                    emerged in the market in recent years that are leveraging AI for delivering a plethora for
                    operations for BFSI. In developing markets, governments have been focusing on preparing an ecosystem
                    with seamless connectivity, where AI technology is conventional, and developed for improving various
                    aspects of e-governance. This would further help in nurturing innovations in conventional
                    industries, allowing novel business models as well as rising number of startups. The increasing
                    application of AI technology is already bringing seismic changes in the retail sector. In addition,
                    AI and ML technologies are being increasingly used for operating various functions, including
                    payment services, logistics and delivery, manufacturing, customer recommendations, and sales and CRM
                    applications. AI startups are also looking at ways to develop solutions that would help retailers in
                    improving their inventory management. </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">With the US leading the world in terms of discoveries and adoption of AI technology,
                    the country also holds a major share of investments from public and private sectors. US-based
                    startups have been actively involved in the research and development of AI technology. Moreover,
                    prominent tech giants, such as Microsoft, IBM, Apple, Google, and Baidu, have been continuously
                    eyeing merger and acquisition opportunities with AI and ML startups. The European AI market, on the
                    other hand, is extremely fragmented with the presence of several leaders and startups utilizing AI
                    technology for scaling up their returns. In recent years, the European Union and the European
                    Commission have rolled out an initiative to invest around US$22.5 billion in AI and ML startups. The
                    funding would be made by the private sector, member states, and the European Union. AI and ML
                    technologies offer lucrative avenues for triggering future growth for forward-thinking corporations,
                    pioneering entrepreneurs, investors, and venture capitalists. In the coming years, AI is expected to
                    foster significant innovations for consumers as well as corporations. Within the automotive
                    industry, AI startups are actively looking at ways of developing technology for self-driving or
                    driverless cars. In conjunction with other transformative technologies, such as Internet of Things
                    (IoT) and big data analytics, AI holds tremendous potential in generating new avenues of economic
                    growth as well as substantial societal value in the coming years.</p>

                  <p class=" m-0">Metaverse is the latest buzzword to capture the imagination of the technology
                    industry. Every year, thousands of startups are launched, with these emerging companies having the
                    potential of disrupting the metaverse industry. These startups offer significant promise in
                    redefining the metaverse landscape by offering highly immersive and engaging experiences to
                    consumers in the future. While metaverse is still in its early development stages and its future
                    outlook continues to remain shrouded with a dense fog of uncertainty, it is not deterring investors
                    from pumping money into metaverse startups. Europeâ€™s metaverse startups raised around US$666 million
                    in funding in 2022, up from US$143 million a year before. Two of the largest funding rounds during
                    the year went to Improbable, a UK-based developer of metaverse platform, which raised US$150 million
                    and US$112 million in two funding rounds. In addition, France-based nfinite, an AI-powered ecommerce
                    and visualization startup banked US$100 million in a Series B funding led by New York-based global
                    technology investor Insight Partners. These funding rounds clearly indicate that investors are keen
                    on jumping on the bandwagon in order to monetize the prospects of the immersive virtual world in the
                    future. Global tech giants, such as Meta and Microsoft, have been spending billions of dollars on
                    developing metaverse components, while metaverse startups, such as Roblox, have been raising
                    significant funds. It still remains unclear which form of the metaverse would prevail or whether
                    several forms would coexist. The metaverse space is evolving rapidly and companies, whether leaders
                    or startups, capable of establishing a truly engaging and immersive space would be the ones that
                    would succeed in the future.</p>

                  <p class=" m-0">Software-as-a-service (SaaS) has rapidly emerged as a dominant technology trend in the
                    recent times. Over the past decade, most of the globally leading software companies have
                    successfully switched to offering cloud-based products, while several others are gradually moving in
                    that direction. The recent COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the trend towards
                    digitalization, which in turn is anticipated to drive enormous growth in the SaaS industry over the
                    next few years. For SaaS companies to succeed, they need to hire skilled workforce in the area of
                    sales with the aim of remote expanding in global markets and closing large deals. For this,
                    companies are primarily focusing on a digital go-to-market strategy, which is expected to augment
                    the demand for skilled digital marketing experts. While companies generally give preference to
                    individuals with a prior B2B technology experience, they are also open to hiring talented
                    professionals from diverse backgrounds and industries. Since SaaS operates on a subscription model,
                    existing customers make up for most of the revenues of SaaS companies. This brings forth the
                    importance of maintaining clear focus on developing meaningful relationships with customers as well
                    as offering them efficient service to ensure continuous revenue growth. This increased focus on
                    customer support and service roles presents lucrative opportunity for IT/BPO professionals to foray
                    into the SaaS industry. Irrespective of the candidateâ€™s prior experience, SaaS companies are
                    willingly offering job aspirants fast-growing and well-paying jobs in case they identify that the
                    candidate has the right skill sets and willing to adapt and learn quickly. Over the years, there has
                    been a tremendous increase in demand for individuals with IT skills, such as Angular JS, data
                    analytics, full-stack development, Android app development, and cloud infrastructure technology.
                    SaaS companies are offering young talent higher salaries and shorter and innovative projects. With
                    increasingly remote and distributed work, companies are also looking at ways to boost culture of
                    employee engagement and innovation. SaaS startups are attracting young talent by offering perks that
                    are most relevant to them, such as gym membership, group health insurance, and mental health
                    sessions.</p>

                  <p class=" m-0">Data privacy and security is a major concern for everyone, and is even more critical
                    for technology-dependent companies. For established companies, it can be nuisance to address issues
                    related to data security, but they still have vast resources for hiring a skilled data security
                    expert or an established IT security vendor. For cash-strapped startups, however, it is not always
                    easy to afford these options. There are various other solutions through which startups can ensure
                    data privacy and security without incurring high costs. One of these includes keeping IT informed
                    and visible. IT needs to be constantly aware and visible about the different tools being used in the
                    company, how and where company data is being stored, and what workers are doing with this data. In
                    the modern work environment, the line between business and personal devices is blurring rapidly and
                    mobile devices are ubiquitous. Employees could unknowingly introduce threat of data breaches to the
                    company. IT needs to be proactively involved in preventing such data breaches and addressing them in
                    case they occur. In addition, startups need to create data security policies that comprise specific
                    file sharing guidelines. Small businesses are generally targeted by cybercriminals as they are aware
                    that adequate resources are not allocated by these companies for addressing these risks. It is vital
                    for startups to identify the assets that are critical, with complete clarity on where these assets
                    are stored, and whether they have been secured via encryption. Another important aspect for startups
                    to protect their data is by minimizing collection. Companies should refrain from collecting
                    protected information from employees and customers unless this information is truly required for
                    their operations. In addition, information that is not required anymore should be destroyed. </p>

                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">Startups should also allocate some time and money for training their employees on how
                    to prevent cyberattacks. Employee training could include identification of suspicious attachments
                    and links from phishing attacks, ways to create a secure and reliable password, physical security of
                    devices, least privilege access, social engineering identification, and data loss prevention.
                    Moreover, startups can opt for outsourcing data breach prevention and other data security functions
                    to established compliant vendors and experts. Most startups generally cannot afford having in-house
                    threat intelligence for protecting against threats. Moreover, it is often difficult for startups to
                    afford advanced, industrial-grade tools. Startups can opt for storing their data on a cloud-based
                    solution that offers both application-level security as well as data-centric security. Several
                    established technology players, such as Google and Microsoft, offer solution specifically designed
                    to meet the requirements of small businesses, and are reasonably priced and available with the
                    option of scaling in accordance with the startupâ€™s growth. Another cost-effective method for
                    startups to protect their data is through encryption. In addition to encrypting sensitive
                    information, such as social security numbers and credit card numbers, other types of information,
                    including email addresses, should also be considered for encryption. Encryption keys should ideally
                    be stored on a server different from the one storing secured data. Startups can also protect
                    themselves from data breaches by regularly conducting penetration testing. Several penetration
                    testing tools are available in the market in different price range. </p>

                    of Freelancing Economy in the Startup Ecosystem</button>

              <div id="collapse5" aria-labelledby="headingThree" data-parent="#accordionExample" class="collapse">
                <div class="card-body p-5 textless">
                  <p class=" m-0">Freelancing is one trend that has been gaining steady pace over the past few years. In
                    2015, more than 34% of the American workforce in the US was earning income from freelancing jobs. In
                    India, the number of gig workers has been witnessing steep growth over the past few years. Apart
                    from the growing freelancing economy, another major trend that has emerged in recent times is the
                    startup ecosystem maturing in the Indian subcontinent. In the near future, freelancing and startup
                    ecosystem are likely to feed off the growth story of both. Most startups globally are generally
                    either service-based or product-based. For product-based companies, it is imperative for them to
                    have a robust technology team comprising the most skilled product managers and programmers. Indian
                    startups are primarily service-based, developing solutions for completing a task using technology.
                    For service-based firms, there is a need to validate their business model before it can churn out
                    world-class apps or websites. This typically requires a strong technical team. Irrespective of
                    whether the startup is service-based or product-based, the freelancing domain can contribute
                    significantly in helping them in scaling in a cost-efficient and asset-light manner. This can be
                    achieved through outsourcing the entire product to freelancers or supplementing the core technical
                    team with freelancers. Freelancers can help companies in building a minimum viable product or a
                    basic workable solution, which can help startups in saving considerable amounts of money, as well as
                    validating their ideas quickly. In case the business model seems viable, companies can go for
                    additional funding for creating a more extensive product. In case the pilot succeeds, the minimum
                    viable product can be utilized for refining the ideas and improving the productâ€™s credibility, both
                    for potential employees as well as funding sources. Apart from technology, the two other major areas
                    where freelancing could prove to be conducive are content writing and design. While there are
                    already various websites available that detail previous projects and experiences of various
                    freelancers, a few startups are emerging that are pushing the envelope by providing validation of
                    the freelancersâ€™ skill sets, matching the most appropriate freelancer as per the requirements, and
                    easing the project execution. These aspects have significantly revolutionized the entire freelancing
                    experience as well as have made it extremely compelling for companies to hire freelancers. Startups,
                    especially those operating in India, stand to benefit the most of the emerging freelancing
                    landscape. Companies can leverage the benefits of receiving a customized solution to their problems
                    as well as enable the budding entrepreneurs in hiring the best talent without incurring heavy costs.
                    Whether a nascent startup, an entrepreneur, or just a person with an idea, freelancing can be an
                    ideal solution for transforming dreams into reality without the hassle of investing in an in-house
                    workforce. </p>

                  <p class=" m-0">There are several trends that are likely to drive the future of startup landscape over
                    the next few years. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Biotech startups are witnessing renewed interest from investors with more and more people
                      across the globe now increasingly focusing on personal health and wellness brought on by the
                      recent COVID-19 pandemic. In recent years, a host of new biotech startups have emerged across the
                      globe. The global biotech market is expected to expand with DNA analysis becoming more mainstream
                      and advanced. Over the last decade, ancestry tests have gained prominence as means of finding
                      about genetic relatives and ancestors. In the coming years, DNA analysis could also offer people
                      the prospect of identifying their future actions. For instance, UK-based healthcare firm, DnaNudge
                      Ltd., offers a cheek swab DNA test, a wristband, and mobile app for providing users nutrition
                      recommendations specifically tailored to their individual DNA. </li>
                    <li> New products are being developed that are leveraging AI technology for identifying the most
                      appropriate exercise routine or skincare products based on the userâ€™s DNA. In the future,
                      technology could also advance to enable an individualâ€™s DNA to align with the current lifestyle
                      and goals rather than the individual adapting to the DNA. </li>
                    <li> Another major trend that is evolving is the gradual spreading of digital innovation in Africa.
                      Over the past few years, African startups are attracting a considerable amount of venture capital
                      investment. In 2020, African startups raised venture capital funding of US$2 billion. For
                      instance, Twiga Foods, a Kenya-based food logistics startup, has received funding from lenders and
                      investors led by US-based investment bank Goldman Sachs. In addition, South African AI-powered
                      fintech startup Jumo has secured significant investment. Another Africa-focused ecommerce startup
                      Jumia ended up listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Success of these African startups is paving
                      way for more startup ventures to emerge on the continent. </li>
                    <li> A notable trend surrounding startups is that sustainable finance is going mainstream.
                      Sustainable finance refers to the process of taking environmental, social and governance
                      considerations into account when making investment decisions. With investors now broadening their
                      scope of return on investment, startups are also pitching for aspects beyond revenue trajectories
                      and including their ecological and social effects. For instance, Beyond Meat Inc., a Los Angeles,
                      California-based food startup has been emphasizing in their investor relations presentation that
                      their plant-based vegan meat is good for consumers as well as the planet.</li>
                    <li> Over the past few years, startups such as DoorDash, Uber Eats, and GrubHub, have established a
                      business model for food delivery, while ride-hailing apps Lyft and Uber have disrupted the
                      conventional taxi industry. Startups are now attracting venture capital investment for rolling out
                      the same proven business models in other geographies. One such example includes Spanish startup
                      Glovo, which has secured funding worth US$1.2 billion. Glovo offers a standard food delivery app
                      and operates across Europe, with plans of expanding operations in North Africa and South America.
                      Glovo offers users the facility of tracking their deliveries in real-time. In addition, apart from
                      food items, Glovo also delivers other items, including flowers, pet food, smartphone accessories,
                      and even macarons. </li>
                    <li> In recent years, there has been a tremendous boom in no-code startups. San Francisco,
                      California-based Webflow, Inc., which offers a platform to enable users build no-code to low-code
                      customized websites and apps, has secured funding worth US$334.9 million. </li>
                    <li> Over the past decade, the sharing economy has gained tremendous momentum. The sharing economy
                      initially emerged in the hotel industry, with Airbnb allowing homeowners to rent out their houses
                      for earning an additional income. In current times, the scope of shared economy is expanding to
                      various other sectors, such as delivery-only restaurants. </li>
                    <li> Startups are also looking actively at streamlining agile development with tools and techniques
                      that help in removing friction and enforcing good practices. </li>
                    <li> Consumer markets are placing higher emphasis on convenience. One such startup is Lensabl,
                      which offers an online prescription lenses replacement service, thus disrupting the traditional
                      market by offering convenience to customers. </li>
                    <li> Agtech innovations are also witnessing an increased demand and hence are increasing attracting
                      the attention of venture capital investors. </li>
                    <li> Startups are also increasingly focused on personalization, and this trend is likely to
                      continue over the next few years. </li>
                    <li> Wealthtech is an area where startups are witnessing increased investment. Wealthtech startups
                      such as Robinhood and Webull continue to secure significant funding from investors.</li>
