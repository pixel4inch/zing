Researchers from across the world present their best work to HRI to exchange ideas about the theory, technology, data, and science furthering the state-of-the-art in the field. The conference theme for HRI 2023 is “HRI for all” and will focus on key HRI theories, methods, designs, studies, and technical advances that aim to understand and promote inclusion and diversity in HRI. We encourage the community to consider ways to both make the field a more inclusive place for those who may not feel included, as well as to encourage inclusion within our research methods and practices. There are many ways to participate in HRI 2023, including full papers, late breaking reports, demos, videos, and workshops. There are many opportunities particularly for students and those new to the field to be involved, including via volunteering and participating in mentoring workshops. The conference will be held from March 13-16, 2023 in Stockholm, Sweden. We aim to have it be a hybrid conference, with opportunities to participate both in person and online. ",
