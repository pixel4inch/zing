                    <li><strong>AI-Powered Biometric Security Solutions Soon to Gain Momentum -</strong> AI is expected
                      to transform authentication, security, and other related factors. AI can help in preventing frauds
                      to a great extent. AI can be used as an additional layer in organizations to help adapt, protect
                      and prioritize their customer services and experiences. Biometrics comprises of a variety of
                      modalities related to customer authentication such as behavioral, voice, and facial recognition,
                      making vital considerations simpler, faster, and more secure. Biometric authentication not only
                      improves organizational security efforts but also allows convenient and frictionless customer
                      experiences. AI and ML enabled biometric technologies are steadily proliferating the market while
                      holding immense potential play a major role in future security technologies. The efficiency of ML
                      in collecting, processing, and analyzing large data sets can substantially enhance the performance
                      of modern biometric systems. As ML networks excel in matching tasks accurately and quickly,
                      biometrics system becomes more efficient, accurate and viable than the existing systems. A
                      DL-based face anti-spoofing tools secures a face recognition system and prevents any attempts by
                      fraudsters to imitate the original face that is registered in the system. AI is of special
                      importance in biometric security, especially with regard to behavioral and multimodal biometrics.

                    <li><strong>AI Regulations to Get More Serious -</strong> The extensive and ever-increasing use of
                      AI is bound to drive regulations in the industry. Though in its early stages, AI regulation is in
                      the works and emerging as a major enterprise concern. Concerns are growing among companies about
                      AI regulation by governments. Though AI regulations are unlikely to come into effect majorly in
                      Europe and the United Kingdom, advances will take place, particularly in the EU. In April 2021,
                      the AI Act was put forward by the European Commission. This act outlines many risk categories,
                      applying more stringent restrictions and regulations to certain use cases coming under higher-risk
                      categories, like facial recognition, and outrightly banning use cases like those that manipulate
                      humans to circumvent their free will or engage in social scoring schemes by governments. In the
                      United States, while the AI regulation is yet to be introduced, the Federal Trade Commission has
                      already warned firms about issues like algorithmic discrimination as well as how the current
                      legislation can penalize those guilty of flouting the rules. In 2021, China put into effect major
                      laws – The Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law. Enacted in November 2021,
                      the former determines how user data may be utilized while the latter, which was passed in
                      September 2021, forces firms to classify information depending on its relevance and economic value
                      to Chinese national security. More legislations are expected to follow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transformation in Robotics Begins With AI -</strong> AI in robotics is the integration
                      of AI technology with robots enabling them to more efficiently perform repetitive tasks without
                      human intervention. AI also enables robots to establish communication with other robots and
                      humans. For companies, robots are proving to be more efficient and at the same time a cheaper
                      labor. Emergence of new tools for analysis of big data is also expected to contribute to market
                      growth for AI in robots going forward. Strong growth is anticipated for the market for AI in
                      robotics over the coming years as industries recognize the powerful combination of the two
                      technologies offering several benefits in automation of processes and tasks. AI in robotics
                      enables industries to become increasingly flexible in their processes. The technology provides
                      robots with the learning ability critical for applications. Companies would be able to
                      considerably increase productivity, save time and also make workplace safer for human workers. AI
                      and robotics combination can also enhance potential of human workers. The step ahead for AI would
                      be augmented intelligence which would seamlessly link machine with machine for further
                      productivity gains. </li>
