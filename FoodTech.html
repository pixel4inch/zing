                    <p class=" m-0">The food & agriculture sector's inability to adapt to the pandemic-induced crisis resulted in new food tech that enhances sustainability and efficiency by innovating bioenergy, agriculture, e-commerce, and plant-based meat. Recently, food tech is for convenience, however, it is at present essential to meet the requirements of health and to offer better customer service. The food tech's growing requirement prompted digital innovators to develop technologies that augment the food sector globally. Food techs such as AI, gene editing, and bio-innovations frequently remodel the food sector's way of managing consumers. Furthermore, food tech enables changes in the way firms usually promote and produce food. The rise in food tech startups in the past decade started encouraging healthy eating by launching digitized food appliances, leading to the digitization of several kitchen appliances and the initiation of numerous ways to manage and reduce food wastage. </p>
                    <br />
                 <ul>

                  <li><strong>	Smart Chopsticks -</strong> The dietary habits of a few people aren't by choice, but due to medical reasons, as poor diet leads to potential weight gain, digestive problems, and gastric reflux in a few people. Smart chopsticks are one of such innovations that assist people in making better choices of diet for medical reasons or by choice. Baidu, a Chinese company recently introduced smart chopsticks at a conference held in Beijing. The smart chopsticks connect to an application and detect unsafe or unhealthy food, and on the basis of data acquired by the application. Smart chopsticks then recommend dietary changes or offer various healthy dietary suggestions. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Digitized Fork -</strong> People with busy schedules at times neglect to keep a check on what they regard as insignificant dietary habits. However, neglecting insignificant dietary habits on a regular basis leads to negative impacts on the health of individuals. Therefore food tech assists individuals in eating healthier through Happi Fork, a smart utensil that uses gentle vibrations and indicator lights to alert individuals if they are consuming too slowly or too fast. The smart electronic fork keeps track of an individual's eating habits in turn promoting healthy eating among individuals. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Smart Kitchens -</strong> A few food tech firms are trying to simplify food prep by advancing futuristic kitchens alongside smart utensils. Smart kitchens are anticipated to transform food prep by launching interactive kitchen appliances, methods of disposing of green waste, and smart ovens and refrigerators. The rise in food tech startups digitized kitchen appliances in the past decade, in turn promoting healthy eating that leads to a highly sustainable environment in the urbanized world. Consecutively several kitchen appliances have been digitized and new approaches to manage and reduce waste. Millo Appliances concentrates on encouraging healthy lifestyles by improving the existing kitchen appliances' capabilities. The first appliance of Millo Appliances called the smart blender utilizes touch-sensitive and cordless technology, and consists of an application that enables people to remotely control the smart blender. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Digitized Disposable Waste -</strong> Global awareness about the effect of food waste in the restaurant sector had been less in the past. However, due to the rise in food waste startups, several restaurants are making efforts to decrease food waste by discovering more responsible approaches to dispose of waste consciously. Winnow, the UK-based startup to assist restaurants in analyzing and eliminating waste, advanced a digital weighing scale that weighs waste bins. Smart waste bins inform restaurants about food waste with regard to environmental and cost impact. The smart waste bins give suggestions to assist kitchens in running more sustainably and efficiently utilizing data analytics. Winnow's smart bins are anticipated to enable restaurants to decrease food waste by 40% to 70%. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Alternative Proteins - </strong>Alternative protein sources are one of the most commonly observed food technology trends now due to increasing consumer concerns about their health as well as the health of the environment. Plant-based nutrition, lab-grown food, cultured meat, mycoprotein, and edible insects are the primary sources of alternative protein. Besides being nutrient-rich, these sources also enable use of resources directly from farm to fork, rather than deriving protein from livestock. In addition, these sources minimize the overall costs, because they incur relatively less health monitoring and marginal dietary requirements. Advancements in molecular biology, fermentation, and 3D printing allow start-ups to develop solutions that support sustainable production of alternative protein. This in turn helps food companies offset the ethical issues associated with industrial meat production and carbon footprint. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Nutraceuticals -</strong> After the outbreak and worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increasing consumer focus on food habits and eating healthy. This concern led to an emphasis on essential nutrients as critical for a healthy lifestyle, and making nutraceuticals one of the food industry’s top trends. Nutraceuticals include functional foods, nutritional supplements, medicinal food, and foods such as probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics that could enhance gut microbiomes. Scientific research reveals that these various types of nutraceuticals could offer protection against oxidative stress-related health disorders such as immune diseases, diabetes, allergy, and Alzheimer’s disease.</li>
                  <li><strong>	eCommerce - </strong>The presence of eCommerce in the food & beverages sector is there since a few years now. The COVID-19 crisis expanded this by further driving innovations related to supply chains and food deliveries. Food brands use digital platforms to offer delivery services through online on-demand, or via direct-to-customer (D2C) models of distribution. Many brands are also planning for omnichannel distribution along with D2C to increase sales and improve customer experience. In addition, the safety concerns that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic promoted the growth of cloud kitchens or ghost kitchens that offer take-away food deliveries only. The adoption of eCommerce in the food & beverage industry enables food manufacturers to ensure availability and also reach their customers more easily.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Transparency and Food Safety -</strong> Transparency and food safety is a major concern today, as customers become more conscious about the quality of the food products they purchase and consume. The widespread availability of standalone devices for food grading, and the use of smart labels help consumers make informed decisions before buying food items. Moreover, the use of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices for real-time monitoring, and advancements in blockchain allow food brands to provide consumers with end-to-end traceability. Transparency and food safety is further ensured by the development of scalable and cost-effective monitoring solutions by many start-ups. All these developments contribute to increasing the trust between consumers and food producers, in turn positively impacting sales and brand credibility.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Personalized Nutrition -</strong> The significant rise in consumer nutrition awareness is driving the need for the development of personalized nutrition solutions. Besides meeting the growing demand for clean-label food products and nutrigenomics-based diets, food manufacturers also need to take into account personal preferences in terms of gluten-free and sugar-free diet, and vegan diet. Innovations such as 3D printing and adoption of robotics in assembly lines enable food producers achieve nutrition personalization at scale. Moreover, urine- and blood-based at-home testing kits are also available to help consumers determine the diet and food products that ideally suit their genetic profiles. Additionally, there are various tracking devices that allow users to track their health conditions and streamline their diet. While these trends help consumers make their dietary preferences on a daily basis, they also help food companies improve sales and customer convenience.  </li>
                  <li><strong>	Reduction of Food Waste - </strong>Globally, a large amount of the food produced is wasted or lost. Avoiding such food wastage is vital to addressing the issue of food insecurity, save costs, and also reduce environmental footprint. Therefore, large corporations and food entrepreneurs are now increasingly focusing on the development of food monitoring solutions that could help smart cities, food producers, and restaurants reduce food wastage. There is also a paradigm shift from the approach of reduction of food waste to zero waste in food production and supply. Food brands are reusing and upcycling food waste by reaching out to consumers who are interested in sustainability, while generating value. 3D printing solutions enable printing edible food items from food waste, thus reducing waste of food at restaurants and various other food outlets. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Smart, Plastic-Free, and Eco-Friendly Packaging -</strong> For several decades, food manufacturers were using plastic in one form or the other in their packaging, because plastic was the most convenient and cheapest solution. However, recent concerns on climate change and shifting consumer perspectives are driving food manufacturers to adopt some green solutions. Some countries in the European Union were the first to impose ban on single-use plastics, and many countries, including the US, across the world are slowly starting to do so. There are also cases where companies are turning to biodegradable and edible packaging. Edible packaging contains food-grade polymers that are safe for human consumption, sea-weed for example. In cases where consumers might not choose to eat the packaging, though edible, the food-grade polymer would naturally decay over time, without causing any harm to the environment Biodegradable packaging uses polymer-derived plastic, which would degrade by the action of living organisms. In smart packaging, which comes in the form of “nano-packaging”, nanotechnology is used to detect the microbial changes brought in the food items, through either physical or chemical causes. Thus, the use of nanotechnology in the packaging helps determine whether the food item is nearing spoiling, and ensure its quality and safety for consumption.</li> 
                  <li><strong>	Beverages That are More Than Just Drinks -</strong> Alongside the advancements in nutritional research, people are also becoming increasingly conscious of the ingredients in their chosen beverages, and are avoiding highly processed and sugary drinks that do more harm to their health than good. This trend led to the growing popularity of health drinks such as Kombucha and other functional beverages that offer various types of benefits. Many other functional beverages, beyond the already available probiotic- and prebiotic-rich drinks, are expected to be launched during 2023. Fermented drinks and dairy beverages enriched with Omega-3 would be some of these functional beverages.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Sophisticated Computerized Technology -</strong> Advancements are continuing in computerized technology in food processing, making autonomous equipment and automation integral to food production as well as food processing. In these times of surging demand and increasing costs, automation could be the key to reduce production time and increase output. Robotic butchery machine is a typical example of an automated machinery that is gaining popularity, due to its ability to accelerate the process. In addition, these automated machines make the facility safer by minimizing the impact of handling potentially hazardous machinery and tools on workers.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Modern Drainage Systems -</strong> New varieties of drainage systems ensure better sanitation and improved safety across the facilities performing food & beverage processing. For example, the 10,000 Series Slot Drain system, which is a more modern version of the conventional trench drain system, features a grate-less design, with a pre-sloped structure to prevent water stagnation and bacterial growth. This system is made of food-grade stainless steel, which is extremely durable and resistant to corrosion, temperature, bacteria, and odor. As a heavy-duty equipment with Load Class E rating, this Slot Drain system is capable of withstanding heavy forklift traffic and heavy flow rates. Most importantly, the system allows easy and quick cleaning and maintenance. Slot Drain system also allows using automated cleaning options such as clean-in-place and Flush-Flo.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Modernization of Traditional Processing Methods  -</strong> The food processing industry is witnessing a return to the tried and tested processing methods, with improvements based on advanced technology. In particular, fermentation is experiencing a strong revival in technique, due to ever-growing demand for fermented foods & beverages. The ancient and original method of fermentation involved mixing saliva or wild rice with decaying fruit in bowls in small batches and left to ferment. Over the centuries, the fermentation process became more streamlined and some the less desirable substance were taken out. Now, modern technology is enabling easier and safer large-batch fermentation with advanced analysis tools, precision temperature controls, and various other equipment that enable meeting the growing demand for fermented products in a safer manner.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Focus on Trust and Transparency -</strong> During the past 30 years, there were large-scale recalls, which led to a weakening of trust between the food industry and consumers. As such, the next trend that could be expected during 2023 is personnel in the higher levels of the food & beverages industry working towards realigning their values, and regaining consumers’ trust by being more transparent. The continued success of many e-commerce-based, smaller food & beverage brands is expected to drive larger brands to be more dynamic, adopt better ways of showing corporate social responsibility, and try to remain competitive. New technologies such as traceability enablers and blockchain could help companies to be more transparent and improve on their reputation by more carefully tracking the origins and quality of their products, along with the various other tactics they usually employ, to regain the trust of their consumers.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Use of Forward Osmosis - </strong>The concentration process used in food processing plants enables to keep the food products fresh till they reach consumers. Further collaborative research in this area by Australia-based CSIRO organization and a US-based membrane technology company resulted in the development of a new membrane technology for preservation processing to concentrate liquids. This process, which is known as “forward osmosis”, is a “gentler” process that does not use heat, and also uses less energy to concentrate food. Forward Osmosis also helps in natural retention of more of the vitamins, proteins and other food nutrients through the processing. The resulting product is of a higher quality than those made with traditional concentration methods.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Animal-Free, Plant-Based Products - </strong>Over the past few years, plant-based products and animal-free meat alternatives gained immense popularity, due to various factors including constantly emerging new health trends, issues related to climate change, and ethical concerns around factory farming. Though the concept of animal-free foods is not new but were there since many years, they are becoming more commonplace only recently, thanks to brands such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat. Greater number of new players and a wider range of product offerings are expected to enter this market in 2023.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Autonomy, Beyond Automation -</strong> During the past two years, just a few robotic applications and automated tasks were seen in restaurants. These included frying potatoes, flipping burgers, making pizzas, and poking bowls from a vending machine, all of these creating a whole new consumer experience. The year 2023 is expected to witness greater role of the robotics in food service, expanding from single-task automation to getting an entire meal cooked solely by robots. Remy’s autonomous kitchens located across Europe are working on a new way of using their anthropomorphic robotic chefs, not just mimicking human actions but using them for what they are best at, namely precision, repetition, and speed, to deliver a whole meal with different cuisines, recipes, and dish types. The key to achieving this is in partnering with the robots, instead of putting them apart.  Restaurants could build on the commissary kitchen, which is an important element of modern food service operations, where humans prepare and handle food, and let robots cook in separate autonomous kitchens using algorithms. This method would allow them to make any type of food with consistent quality and deliver in a timely manner to the end customer. This technology could be applied to catering, QSR, delivery restaurants, and practically to any kind of food service operator. This concept experienced initial success in Europe, suggesting that this model would soon be on its way to the broader global market.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Better Job Environment -</strong> The labor shortage that exists today in food service implies that the industry needs to evolve, in terms of providing better working conditions and better hours in order to ensure staff retention. Though deploying might appear counterintuitive, treating people better is possible by the use of more robots. The present times represent a historical phase in food service, when some jobs no longer exist in their current shape at least. In the same way as workers in car production facilities are not lifting heavy weights due to the adoption of new technologies, food service jobs could also introduce new technologies to avoid people working under stressful conditions and at unsocial hours, and performing repetitive tasks. All these tasks could be left to the robots. A commissary kitchen-based model with a hub and spoke working 8 to 5 and allowing robots to cook 24/7 could create a better job environment that people would like to stay in. As exemplified by Remy, workers in such as place would love the work they do, while being ensured of a social life, sufficient time to spend with family, along with career progression. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Greater Profitability -</strong> Till now, the accepted fact in food service is that margins are tough. But robotics could change that in 2023. With fewer personnel to hire, lower staff costs, and less turnover, achieving greater profitability would not be an impossible goal.  The right type of robotics could enable restaurants to minimize labor costs, reduce waste, and standardize food quality. Hardware-based technologies such as salad-mixing machines and pizza-in-a-box solutions that were introduce in 2022 are limited solutions, and do not give operators the versatility, which is the most important requirement when working with food. The aim must be to sell more than a certain type of dish, rather than locking initial investment in a single offering without the adaptability to make changes as per market demands. Scalability and profitability could come with flexible, adaptive, software-based robotics solutions that enable cooking multiple dishes without the need to change hardware. More of such robotic solutions are expected to be introduced, particularly in the delivery space, in 2023.</li>
                  <li><strong>	Increased Delivery -</strong> Ghost kitchens and virtual restaurants are expected to continue to dominate in the growth of food service industry. Since these are basically technology-based environments, they would benefit from most of the innovations, further driven by increasing number of people preferring to eat at home, with the inflation trends expected to restrict their habits of eating out. The year 2023 is also likely to witness at least one pilot project integrated with fully autonomous robotic kitchens and driverless delivery. Remy is already making efforts to build on this trend, with their robotic kitchens capable of cooking food depending on the location of the consumer, through calculating the time required for cooking a dish to perfection and delivering piping hot at the customer’s door.</li>

                    <p class=" m-0">There are several new food tech trends that revolutionized the manufacturing processes in the food & beverage industry and many associated businesses, resulting in beneficial improvements and changes across the board. While all these trends might not involve technological approaches in the traditional sense, everything from materials, equipment used in the facilities, and packaging techniques is part of the transformation that is expected in the food & beverage industry during 2023. The following are some of the exciting tech trends to watch in 2023.</p>
                    <br />
<ul>
  <li><strong>Restaurant Digitization -</strong> Restaurant digitization is another recent trend that allows smooth operation management and helps in enhancing customer experience. In addition, restaurant digitization enables restaurant brands to collect data points at every stage, thus allowing for data-driven decision-making for all their operations. More recently, the disruption caused by the pandemic the food & beverage industry resulted in restaurants deploying digital management systems through the entire supply chain. In order to minimize human-to-human contact and direct interaction, restaurants introduced digital menus, cashless payment methods, and self-service kiosks. Voice bots and chatbots are assisting customers by responding to restaurant-related queries and food orders. Based on consumer behavior and preference data, AI-enabled tools enable developing new recipes and also provide food recommendations to customers. </li>
  <li><strong>AAHI, which is a Czech start-up -</strong> Offers a customer engagement platform to restaurants. The contactless ordering platform of AAHI supports multiple languages, uses QR codes and digital menus, and allows tailoring to brand specifications. The platform minimizes direct contact between restaurant personnel and customers, while providing customers with a unique interactive experience. Such optimization of restaurant-customer interactions contributes to increasing order frequency. AAHI’s Ecological Marketplace enables restaurants to connect with customers who are concerned about sustainability, and to provide them with special offers and earn revenue out of less popular and unsold items, while reducing food wastage.</li>
  <li><strong>Digital Food Management - </strong>Digital food management includes real-time monitoring, AI and big data analytics, and allows direct farm-to-fork food delivery. While start-ups develop solutions to optimize food production processes and streamline supply chain operations, restaurant digitization allows for forecasting demand based on analysis of customer behavior and preferences. For example, start-ups used quantum computing to analyze critical situations such as disruptions due to the pandemic, and efficiently simulate market fluctuations. These solutions together help food producers understand market requirements better and foresee disruptions, thus managing surplus food and reducing losses. In addition, market intelligence enables brands to tweak their marketing strategies if necessary and reach the relevant consumer more effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart QR Menus and Contactless Payment -</strong> The pandemic of Covid-19 clearly spreads by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces, which made consumers worry about eating outside or ordering in. Therefore to ensure the safety of consumers, restaurants created QR codes for their menus to reduce cross-contamination. The customers simply scan the QR code with their smartphones and the menu gets displayed on the mobile phone screens to make an order and enjoy the food. To make a payment, customers are enabled to scan the QR again for their bill to generate and make a contactless payment. </li>
  <li><strong>Customization of Meals and Tracking of Food Ingredients Online -</strong> Eating trends transformed over time and consumers, specifically, millennials seek ready-to-eat food that is easily available and healthy at the same time. Consumers regularly check the nutrition facts and the contents provided on the packaged food labels. At present, with the tech integration of food service businesses, consumers are enabled to customize their food based on their calorie intake and preference. The online tracking technology of ingredients assists in getting the ingredients of the best quality to prepare a dish. It is essential to augment food traceability due to the swift growth in awareness about food fraud, leading innovation further in the food ecosystem. </li>
  <li><strong>AI Leveraging Smart Cameras -</strong> Smart cameras integrated with AI technology assists in detecting food wastage inside commercial kitchens, and the cameras track every worker who is working inside the kitchen. The smart cameras identify a worker who isn't wearing the uniform, which assists in assuring safety measures. Furthermore, the robotic machines' usage in huge commercial kitchens assists in increasing productivity in a short time span. The food tech sector is working on various fronts to provide the best experience of dining to customers whether it is an office or home. </li>
  <li><strong>Robotics -</strong> The incorporation of robotics in the entire value chain of the food & beverage industry enables improving consistency, efficiency, and scale during production. Hospitality robots that are being deployed at restaurants and hotels enable enhancing convenience and safety of customers. Another major food technology trend is the use of food processing robots and robotic chefs. Autonomous vehicles and drones, besides being more efficient than manual delivery services, save overall costs as well. Food handling robots and drones in grocery stores and warehouses allow for quick and cost-effective tagging and monitoring of food products. In short, the emergence of robotics in the food industry is accelerating food production, enabling accurate food quality control, and boosting revenue for food producers and providers.</li>
  <li><strong>The US-based start-up - </strong>Bear Robotics created Servi, which is a robot that allows automatic food and drinks service. Servi helps waiters carry the dishes with a low footprint by enabling easy navigation in crowded and narrow spaces. Servi uses laser sensors and cameras for navigation, this avoiding blind spots. Moreover, the safety-first design of Servi prioritizes changing direction or stopping when any intervention comes across. The solutions of Bear Robotics help improve operating efficiency, enhance service quality, and make hospitality more manageable.</li>
  <li><strong>3D Food Printers - </strong>3D food printers are used to personalize alternative protein-based meals and diet, and also to offer precise, reproducible nutrition. While material extrusion still remains the most commonly used method for food printing, start-ups are now using bioprinting methods, and inkjet and laser printing to develop food products, because these approaches allow increasing the precision and quality of 3D-printed food products. With food brands seeking products with quality reproducibility and precise specifications, further research is being conducted to develop 3D food printing solutions that could reduce the costs and complexity in large-scale food production. 3D printing also enable food brands to offer customers with personalized food products without the need for additional tooling that could increase operational costs.  </li>
  <li><strong>SavorEat, which is an Israeli start-up - </strong>  Produces plant-based meat using proprietary 3D printing, non-GMO ingredients, and chef robots. SavorEat produces meatless burgers currently, but is planning to expand to alternative seafood, kebabs, and steaks. The meat alternatives of SavorEat recreate the unique texture, taste, and experience of real meat, and are also customizable to specific lifestyles, diets, and tastes. SavorEat’s proprietary 3D printing technology is highly suitable to offer quick, consistent, and accurate results for hotels, restaurants, and food trucks. </li>
