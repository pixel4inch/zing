                  <p class=" m-0">Over the last few years, there has been significant growth in the adoption of cutting
                    edge technologies. More than 4.8 billion people across the world are active internet users and the
                    increase in smartphone adoption has also contributed largely in expanding healthcare’s digital
                    footprint. Today, several patients want their digital experience in healthcare to mimic their retail
                    experience. Patients are more likely to choose healthcare services according to their digital
                    competencies. Most of the patients prefer to use smartphones to connect with their healthcare
                    providers. Also, there has been an expansion of personalized monitoring devices and mobile
                    healthcare apps. Use of wearable devices related to health and fitness has increased significantly
                    in the last few years and this increase is anticipated to continue in the future. Developments in
                    digitalization, increasing interest among people in health & wellness, and enhanced capabilities of
                    affordably-priced wearables are driving patient empowerment and connecting health-related data to
                    mainstream consumer experience. Widespread availability of medical information allows patients to
                    understand their health better, choose their health care providers, and play an active role in
                    determining the necessary course of treatment, all these remotely without visiting a doctor.
                    Accordingly, traditional healthcare models are undergoing changes to accommodate the more proactive
                    role of the patients and to meet their demands for personalized and cost-effective treatments based
                    on their personal preferences and medical history.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p class=" m-0">As technological advancements continue to proliferate the healthcare ecosystem, more
                    patients and physicians are willing to use digital devices to connect with each other to receive

                    digitalized and will migrate to more technological friendly way of operating. The rising wave of
                    digital innovation around healthcare is supported by aging population, rise in infectious and
                    chronic diseases and shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. Developing countries in
                    particular, face a significant shortage of skilled clinicians to address the growing healthcare
                    burden. The widening gap between professionals and increasing population is creating significant
                    challenges for public and private health systems. India faces a significant shortage of medical
                    professionals in rural areas where more than two thirds of the population reside. In Germany, there
                    is expected to be a shortage of 1.3 million health care professionals by 2030. Healthcare providers
                    are therefore turning to sophisticated tools such as data analytics and Internet-of-Things to
                    recalibrate business models to meet rising consumer demand. Digital health is also driven by the
                    rise and proliferation of patient data stored in the form of electronic forms saving time and space.
                    Electronic health records (EHRs) or electronic medical records (EMRs) comprise data of patient
                    prescription, drug intakes, and medical history enabling the physicians to commence accurate
                    diagnosis and reduce waiting times.</p>

                    helping the organizations to improve their quality and costs, offer better treatment to at-risk
                    patients, and connect with wide range of consumers.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">Tele-health is the most popular segment of mHealth applications and at the center of
                    the burgeoning telehealth trend in the healthcare sector is its deliverability through smartphones
                    that are the most used device in the world. Public reimbursement, prevailing regulations, strategy
                    and policy landscape, along with necessary government support are the critical elements that
                    currently define the future of telemedicine industry. Nations with matured telemedicine system in
                    place, are likely to retain teleconsultations beyond COVID-19. Improved medical care at affordable
                    rates can be achieved by integration of pharmaceutical companies with telemedicine services, thereby
                    leading to higher gains. Analogously, MedTech industry can benefit too, by the integration of
                    medical equipment with telemedicine services. Mobile devices and apps are finding an increasing role
                    in telemedicine. Several telemedicine companies are introducing telemedicine apps to enable patients
                    to access and communicate with healthcare providers in remote locations.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">Growing use of 4G/5G networks and increased application areas support the growth of
                    digital health. Major technological advances such as computing power, wireless technology, and
                    miniaturization are driving an exponential increase in the scale and pace of the emergence of
                    digital health care innovations, and impacting both business and clinical operations. In addition,
                    these advances are contributing to increased consumer expectations, which is replacing “going
                    digital” with “being digital” as the new requirement for all health care organizations. Innovations
                    in digital health care are emerging in an increasingly greater scale and pace. Digital technologies
                    provide support to the health systems in their efforts of transitioning to new patient-centered care
                    models and help them adopt “smart health” approaches that would increase access and improve quality
                    at lower costs. Disruptive technologies such as virtual and digital reality, artificial intelligence
                    (AI), Cloud, RPA, Blockchain, robotics, and internet of medical things (IoMT) are helping diagnosis
                    and treatment in terms of speed, accuracy, and quality, and enhancing overall patient experience. As
                    health care becomes “shoppable” with a care-sharing model presenting increasing costs for patients,
                    enhancing patient experience could be the potential area for significant change. Many
                    non-traditional companies from the retail, technology, and consumer sectors are also starting to

Discussed below are few of the important technology innovations that have the potential to transform your healthcare organization in 2023.</p>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence – </strong>AI is transforming the concept of healthcare
                      delivery. Healthcare AI applications are capable of augmenting human activity, i.e. take up tasks
                      such as medical imaging, diagnosis of health conditions and risk analysis, which is a considerable
                      progress from legacy technologies consisting of algorithms or tools that were capable of only
                      complementing actions of humans. With healthcare organizations confronting challenges in the form
                      of rising operating costs amidst increasing labor expenditure, growing demand for digital

                      degree of interoperability, enhanced clinical data management and flawless supply chains.
                      Blockchain presents the perfect technology for dealing with various challenges associated with
                      time-intensive, manual options employed by the healthcare industry for, provider credentialing and
                      patient record sharing. The technology eliminates issues caused by conventional data-sharing
                      approaches and infrastructure, such as privacy concerns, duplicate records and false positives.
                      Blockchain allows organizations to share patient data in an auditable manner while mitigating
                      privacy issues. The technology allows sharing of information or transaction details in real-time
                      in an immutable and secure fashion. In the pharmaceutical value chain for instance, blockchain
                      technology impacts all aspects, including improving supply chain transparency, and enhancing data
                      collection in clinical trials. With blockchain technology, the supply chain of drugs and medical
                      equipment can become more secure, streamlined and efficient. The technology-backed development and

                      complete control over the patient data. Integration of blockchain also enables clinicians to
                      undertake secure sharing of clinical data. </li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare Cloud - </strong> Healthcare cloud computing model helps healthcare
                      organizations to store and manage of their healthcare IT resources as services over cloud. By
                      helping provide access to healthcare information systems and data hosted on external cloud servers
                      to healthcare organizations over the Internet in shared/multi-tenant, dedicated or hybrid service
                      models, healthcare cloud computing especially comes across as the most cost effective healthcare
                      information system provisioning model for healthcare organizations. Collaboration and sharing is
                      as one of the chief clinical benefits of cloud technology. Cloud technology enables different
                      departments which traditionally have maintained huge volumes of data in isolated data silos to
                      share it and in process make optimal utilization of stored data. Data portability and sharing can
                      enable healthcare centers to innovate and extend remote diagnostic and healthcare services to even
                      remote population centers. Easy collaboration centrally accessible data between clinical
                      researchers, physicians and diagnostics can enable development of more effective drug delivery
                      system that can help counter even serious diseases. Given the considerable costs and efforts
                      involved in conducting security assessments, certifications and audits that are often required to
                      demonstrate compliance with the HIPAA security policies, it forces tremendous burden on
                      organizations operating on-premise infrastructure. Cloud technology on the other hand shifts the
                      responsibility of such costs on the cloud service provider (CSP) and since they can bear such
                      costs more easily when compared to private datacenters, cloud technology presents a cost effective
                      option. Furthermore the deployment of an effectively designed and developed cloud based PHI
                      solution can ease compliance technical as well as physical safeguards as stipulated by the HIPAA
                      rules.</li>

                      improving patient outcomes and reducing costs, the approach requires organizations to capture the
                      real essence with appropriate strategies. The market anticipates significant demand in the
                      upcoming years owing to the outbreak. However, constraints such as misuse of patient information
                      and high capital disbursement and maintenance may hamper the market expansion in the short run. As
                      businesses work to address these constraints and lower the cost of digital health solutions,
                      product adoption rates will increase, boosting the market growth. As the role of data analytics
                      increases in healthcare, the sector could benefit in some major ways, including digital health
                      platforms, automated healthcare, data-driven clinical evidence, and AI- and IoT-enabled real-time
                      patient care, practitioner performance evaluation and patient costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT) - </strong> IoT in healthcare has the potential to provide
                      substantial improvement in operational efficiencies by providing improved quality of care at a
                      minimized cost. IoT can help staffing managers in providing for better staffing and scheduling
                      efficiencies, thereby improving workflows. For instance, IoT helps in collecting data related to
                      location of staff, patient location, and the location of important medical equipment. The data can
                      be used to ascertain the movement of equipment and staff, and would enable in predicting the need
                      for the same in various departments. In this way, hospitals will be able to make proper resource
                      allocation and on-demand scheduling. IoT is also useful in handling the critical issue of alert
                      fatigue, which is responsible for a growing number of patient deaths or injuries. Alert fatigue
                      happens when there are too many false alarms. With the help of IoT, healthcare facilities can link
                      smart monitoring devices with patient rooms, records, nursing staff, pharmacies, and other
                      critical information. The sensors embedded in these smart devices capture and collect data, which
                      is then analyzed to ascertain whether a loud alarm should be triggered for critical,
                      life-threatening events or a silent alarm should be triggered for harmless, non-critical events.
                      IoT will therefore help in reducing false alarms, cuts down on work load, and improves timely
                      action, thereby augmenting patient safety and care. Besides improving operational efficiencies,
                      IoT in healthcare also supports physicians in making informed, more accurate and faster diagnosis;
                      and in deciding personalized treatment agendas. </li>
                    <li><strong>Robotics - </strong>Robot-Assisted surgery (RAS), an advanced technological field
                      utilizes robotic skills to aid a surgeon in undertaking precise and delicate procedures in the OR.
                      RAS utilizes precision tools using computerized images and performs surgical procedures with
                      greater accessibility and accuracy than a human hand. Though benefits of RAS are crystal clear,
                      prohibitive costs continue to hinder large-scale adoption of this technology. However, factors
                      such as increased success rates, shorter hospital stay, commercial interests as well as decline in
                      patient morbidity are propelling the growth of RAS. Government focus, application in new surgical
                      areas along with increased awareness among surgeons and healthcare professionals leading to
                      increased adoption is expected to fuel the use of RAS, thereby enabling reduction in costs.
                      Minimally invasive surgery was traditionally used for removal of gallbladder and prostate, as well
                      as for gastrointestinal, gynecologic and urologic procedures. However, with robots being
                      introduced in the medical sector, robot-assisted minimally invasive/non-invasive procedures are
                      slowly replacing more conventional invasive procedures. Starting out as an aid to minimally
                      invasive surgery (MIS), surgical robots have made the big leap and are now slowly taking
                      centerstage in complex surgical procedures. </li>
                    <li><strong>Augmented Reality - </strong> From healthcare professions to medical companies, the
                      entire healthcare industry is opening up to the benefits of augmented reality to carry out their
                      day to day activity. Product research and development teams at medical devices, drugs and
                      pharmaceutical industries can use mobile augmented reality devices, including smart AR glasses to
                      gain 3D view of their products in development or production for more information. Doctors and
                      nurses too can benefit from being able to access critical patient information directly from their
                      near eye devices. Specific apps allow smart AR glasses to overlay information of treatment area
                      directly on the doctor’s field of view. These glasses also allow doctors to monitor patients'
                      vital signs during surgical procedures without having to take their eyes off the patient.
                      Healthcare professions can use smart AR glasses to collect multi-dimensional anatomical data of
                      the patient from different sensors such as CT scans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Computed
                      Tomographic scans, which can be combined in real time with patient view. Live-streaming of
                      surgeries, diagnostic imaging and patient care management are some of the applications driving
                      adoption of AR. Implementing AR enabled smart glasses in healthcare systems offers key benefits
                      such as error reduction, time savings, provides real-time assist in complicated surgeries that
                      require precision, improved clinical documentation, improved patient experience, clinical outcomes
                      and delivery of health care, increased face- to-face engagement with patients, facilitates
                      collaboration in unusual medical cases, and improved education and training programs. </li>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>mHealth Care Gains Momentum: </strong> mHealth care is the most prominent trend within
                        the digital health care market. Of late, mobile health (mHealth) care apps are being
                        increasingly leveraged for performing critical functions, such as patient-to-physician
                        communication. The availability of these health care apps facilitates management of health
                        care-related information, monitoring of patients, scheduling patient appointments, and
                        management of electronic medical records. The contribution of mobile health care technologies
                        within the health care industry is most profound, with long-ranging effect on the industry as a
                        whole. In several regions of the world, in which the penetration of mHealth care apps into the
                        overall health care systems is complete, these apps are making significant contribution in
                        preventing, treating, and managing several chronic diseases. For example, of late, mHealth care
                        apps are playing a key role in preventing and managing Type 2 diabetes. Quin is an app powered
                        by machine learning and algorithmic insights, which aims to help people suffering from type 1
                        diabetes to decide the time and amount of insulin to be taken daily. Driven by the phenomenal
                        increase in the availability of numerous fitness and mHealth care apps, the overall digital
                        health care industry is experiencing exponential growth. Today, while the health care market is
                        flooded with over 318,000 health care apps, 100 new mHealth care apps are being launched on a
                        daily basis. While the increase in the number of health care apps is indeed phenomenal, more
                        significant is their penetration and reach. Today, a minimum of one health care app is being
                        used by a large population of smart phone users, and mHealth care apps are playing an important
                        role within the overall health care ecosystem. The effect of health care apps is so era-defining

                        Internet of Things (IoT) enabled connected health care devices, big data analytics, Blockchain,
                        and geolocation technologies, among several others, is expected to decisively impact the future
                        growth within the worldwide market for digital health apps.</li>
                      <li><strong>Home Health Clubs Make it to the Spotlight - </strong> Home Health Hub is the
                        revolutionary step forward in supporting continuity and care coordination between ACSs and
                        primary healthcare systems. The technology is geared to support remote patient monitoring,
                        tele-health, tele-medicine, and virtual healthcare delivery. Home Health Hub is defined as a
                        combination of hardware and software systems that allow the creation of a medical hub for
                        monitoring, acquiring, and transmitting patient data from point-of-care facility to healthcare
                        professionals in the primary care sector. Home care agencies, nursing homes and assisted living
                        facilities utilize a wide range of home healthcare technologies and represent “hubs” for
                        collecting and transmitting patient data. They therefore are major end-users of home health hub
                        products and services. However, rapid proliferation of digital health technologies are bringing
                        healthcare even closer to the patient, making the patient’s home the point-of-care facility. In
                        addition to the ubiquity of smartphones and tablets and the rise of smartphone-enabled home
                        health hubs, growing penetration of smart homes is also expected to spur growth in the market.
                        Smart homes are helping drive the trend towards connected home-based self-care. A smart home
                        hitherto valued for its unrivalled convenience and comfort is now gaining popularity for its
                        potential to enhance the home healthcare experience. They will play an increasingly important
                        role in the evolution of digital, remote, connected and virtual care systems. A wide range of
                        home monitoring devices, home-based sensors, consumer electronics and mobile apps will help
                        smart homes evolve from just meeting aging-in-place, chronic disease management and post-acute
                        care monitoring needs to healthcare needs of the entire family i.e. maternal, infant/child,
                        adolescent health, and care for physically and intellectually disabled. Sharing electronic
                        healthcare records, managing healthcare sensor data, cloud execution of multimedia-based health
                        services, patient counseling and assisted-living services are few of the healthcare services
                        supported by smart homes. While medical wearables and smartphones enable remote patient
                        monitoring and telemedicine services targeted at disease management, smart homes can help expand
                        the functionality of digital health services from just disease management to health management.
                        In other words, IoHT and smart homes when combined with cloud will revolutionize digital health
                        and will expand the role of digital health beyond elderly care and health monitoring to other
                        areas of wellness, nutrition, exercise, sleep, medication monitoring, mental, social wellbeing,
                        managing pregnancy and prenatal health, among others.</li>
                      <li><strong>2023 Will be Year of Medical Wearables - </strong> Wearable devices are taking a lead

                        from a patient in a remote location. Remote health monitoring is growing in popularity as both
                        patients and healthcare professionals want health to be monitored outside of clinical settings.
                        Remote patient monitoring, also referred to as remote patient management, is a method of
                        healthcare delivery that leverages the latest technological advances to gather patient data
                        outside of traditional healthcare settings. RPM when incorporated in the management of chronic
                        diseases, has the potential to significantly improve quality of life for patients. The
                        technology is most widely used for monitoring heart conditions and diabetes. Medical wearable
                        devices will be joined by activity detection sensors, sleep environment monitoring systems,
                        indoor air quality monitoring sensors, among others to enhance patient monitoring for more
                        effective home-based self-care. Virtual reality (VR) equipment and headsets will double up as
                        devices capable of providing engaging physiotherapy that encourages self-regulated
                        rehabilitation. As wearable technologies become more widely available and cost-effective,
                        wearables are finding a role in many elements of care delivery. Remote patient monitoring
                        enabled by wearables is expected to be a gamechanger for the healthcare industry struggling with
                        ballooning costs. Owing to technological advancements such as IoT and software development,
                        there has been a shift in the design of wearables focused on wellness to tools that allow
                        physicians to remotely track and monitor patients’ vital signs, ranging from blood pressure to
                        oxygen saturation, in real-time. Wearables have the potential to improve patient outcomes by
                        equipping providers with real-time data collection, increasing accuracy and informed decision
                        making. Wearable devices can capture measures of physical activity, promoting continuous
                        monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, glucose, and EKG. Metrics such as resting heart rate
                        serve as an important metric to gauge cardiovascular health, enabling physicians to identify
                        early signs of illness or health issues. Integration of health and fitness apps with wearable
                        technology can be helpful for patients suffering from chronic diseases. It can monitor
                        minute-to-minute chronic conditions of the patients. For example, patients suffering from
                        diabetes are prone to the risk of large fluctuations in blood sugar level. With wearable
                        technology, it is possible to track these fluctuations which help insulin treatment to be
                        tailored with high precision.</li>
                      <li><strong>Telemedicine Goes Mainstream - </strong> The pandemic has made telemedicine popular

                        in-depth insights regarding their patient populations by combining monitoring, longitudinal,
                        genomics, laboratory, and imaging data. Case in point is the multidisciplinary tumor boards.
                        Care teams, with the use of integrated diagnostic solutions, can provide patient-oriented cancer
                        care, integrating patient data from various sources into dashboards, thereby allowing
                        collaborative treatment, diagnostics, and other associated aspects. The aim of this healthcare
                        technology is not the replacement of humans but to provide support to care teams with
                        appropriate guidance based on evidence to facilitate better decision making involving patients
                        for enabling them to have a better life. This is also being witnessed in cardiology, wherein
                        integrated diagnostics improved by predictive analytics and smart algorithms are enabling
                        quicker decision making by care teams by offering suitable, actionable data that aids in
                        improving patient care.</li>
