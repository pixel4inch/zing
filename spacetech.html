Blue Origin is focusing on making an effort to launch its reusable 2-stage New Glenn rocket into LEO. The rocket can be used about 25 times. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Low Cost, Lightweight Satellites -</strong> The declining cost of launching satellites and the increasing number of applications for the data they offer are fueling the number of satellite launches. Lightweight and smaller satellites are emerging, which is allowing even startup companies to enter the space. 3D printed satellites are also being developed. Fleet Space Technologies is expected to launch such satellites which will offer connectivity and communications solutions for IoT devices. </li>
                  <li><strong>	LEO Constellations:</strong> With this, a huge number of applications can be facilitated. Constellation of small-sized craft can offer real-time imaging which can be leveraged for combating fires on the ground, for tracking and detection of planes with the use synthetic aperture radar and hyperspectral cameras, and for navigation purposes, among others. Further, LEO satellites translate to short-term missions which lowers costs and risk. The use of satellites in this manner can augment space innovation, facilitating transition to latest packaging technologies and process nodes sooner. With increase in on-orbit processing that needs greater I/O slots and compute, BGA (ball-grid array) packaging is gaining momentum. There is also a significant rise in development agility being witnessed, leading to quicker analysis and introduction of novel technology. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Organic Packaging:</strong> For space-grade systems, a transition is being witnessed in the industry towards flip-chip packaging and organic packaging. Besides supporting the I/O and the bigger die size required, the dependability of organic packaging is considered to be advantageous. The transition to this will however not be immediate. </li>
                  <li><strong>	Machine Learning:</strong> For overcoming design challenges, processing is expected to be done on-board instead of the ground station. Satellites are expected to process data and transmit information about the meaning of the data. For this, satellites will need to have AI capabilities in orbit, such as image categorization and object identification, among others. </li>
                  <li>AI is a constantly changing area and ML models need continued optimization. An adaptive and flexible architecture is required for space-based systems which can alter algorithms and models promptly.  As ML requires greater compute, hardware acceleration needs to offer responsiveness in real-time. Upon the changing of algorithms, the hardware that is required for algorithm acceleration also undergoes change. Therefore, hardware and software that can be configured is required for an adaptive platform which can update along with one another. In other words, for on-orbit processing, systems should be capable of processing, analyzing, and reconfiguring up until the application code.</li>
