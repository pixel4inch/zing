                    <p class=" m-0">The world gaming industry has over the decades witnessed sea changes in sync with technology changes. From the arcade boom to the rise of home computers and game consoles to the current disruptive mobile based gaming, the industry has seen meteoric rise in popularity over the past several decades. Business models have also continued to change and evolve. Digital games have revolutionized the way games are distributed and sold, and have played instrumental roles in opening up the concept of free-to-play models. With free-to-play games, consumers today spend greater time on games and this translates to greater probability of spending on in-game purchases. As a result business models are shifting from sales of single unit console or software to towards a recurring revenue model where active user base contributes to the revenue turnover potential. New generation games like “Fortnite” and “Call of Duty” are today designed around free-to-play with in-game purchase options which have massive potential for driving revenues for companies like Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive. A recurring payment strategy has more ability to encourage higher average consumer spending than standalone game purchase that dominated the industry less than a decade ago. The incredible success of social games like FarmVille stands testimony to the power of in-game purchases and micro-transactions.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p class=" m-0">But as video games migrate away from console-based experiences to more real-time, digital- and mobile-driven platforms, gamer behavior and the way gamers interact with their games are also rapidly shifting. To increase user engagement rates under such as scenario, companies are looking to develop highly engaging games and also looking to adopt innovative in-game monetization opportunities. The integration of additional downloadable content such as expansion packs, characters, tools, and new features present gaming companies with added avenues to generate revenues. The evolution of this business model has been strongly encouraged by improvements in Internet connectivity, especially mobile Internet services, penetration of cheap mobile data, advancements in gaming hardware which are enabling users to gain access to a wide range of high-quality games across varied platforms and devices; and development of online digital financial transactions. Growing prominence of video games as a form of modern artistic expression and entertainment and acceptance of video gaming as an educative and meaningful leisure activity was the major change in consumer perception triggered by the pandemic that helped and will continue to help expand the audience base for video games. The educational value offered by video games is resulting in the creation of a new trend called “Gamification of Education”, where games are used as valuable high-tech teaching tool to impart 21st century skills such as creative thinking, problem solving and collaboration.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p class=" m-0">The gaming ecosystem comprises of diverse participants encompassing companies with game hardware and software capabilities like Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo; independent developers and self-publishing companies like EA, Activision Blizzard, and Epic Games. Technology developments will create a stronger ecosystem in the coming years. The gaming community is also growing stronger which is a vital prerequisite for growth of the industry. Interactions that emerge from the gameplay both inside and outside the game play key roles in building the gaming community.  “Meta-game” interactions include cheatsheets, hints, player community forums where games are discussed and strategies are analyzed and documented. These often times hold more value than the game itself as they draw in more new gamers into the scene. Game researchers can draw on player reflection, analysis, and collaboration, all contained within this ecosystem, to develop more engaging games.   </p>
                    <br />
                    <p class=" m-0">The industry stands at the cusp of yet another significant development with the advent of web 3.0. Technology promises to open a new era in gaming, from in-game purchases to now allowing players to earn money while they play, a fundamental change in the industry is underway. Supported by web 3.0, players when they spend money to buy a virtual game asset can now own them and sell them to other players, both inside and outside the game. This is unlike web 2.0 where even after buying the asset, the gamer does not own it and cannot monetize it since the asset is tied to the game and not the player. Blockchain technology promises to change this and along with web 3.0 will now enable in-game asset ownership and each asset will have a finite supply with ownership residing with the gamer post sale. As these assets are finite in supply, the scarcity allows players to lucratively sell them to others. A key underlying concept also making this a reality is NFTs that enable digital asset scarcity and ownership similar to digital currency. With in-app purchases driving over 55% of gaming revenue, the ability to monetize gaming skills is a major development that will help games to evolve beyond being just a mere commodity. Games will become economies, and players and game developers will have real economic output.</p>

                      leaders need to be aware to be able to tap into opportunities in a timely manner. Few of the
                      fast-paced cutting edge trends emerging with exceptional clarity include AR/VR, Blockchain, NFT,
                      Cloud-Based Games, and the Metaverse.</p>
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>AR/VR -</strong> Defined as the integration of virtual data into the real world to
                        enhance the physical and sensory perception of the world, Augmented Reality (AR) represents one
                        of the most interactive and digitally versatile innovations of the 21st century. While virtual
                        reality (VR) technology enables creation of an artificial world that a person can explore and
                        experience interactively through sense of vision, audio, tactile or any other feedback,
                        augmented reality takes it one step further by enabling interactive experience in a real world
                        rather than an artificial environment. Already there are hundreds of gaming applications
                        designed for use with Samsung Gear and PlayStation VR. VR applications market will especially be
                        driven by action and adventure genre given the compelling graphics and visuals they bring to the
                        background. A key factor fueling demand for AR/VR games is the immersive experience provided by
                        the technology. The launch of virtual reality-enabled home consoles is also expected to help
                        sustain growth prospects for video gaming consoles market despite the onslaught by online and
                        mobile gaming segments.</li>
                      <li><strong>Cloud Gaming - </strong> Cloud gaming enables game developers and game service
                        providers to provide engaging digital media experiences on any platform, anytime, anywhere and
                        build strong consumer loyalty and also to scale their services globally without burdening their
                        existing infrastructure. Gratifying digital media experiences have the potential to help build
                        rewarding customer relationships and loyalty. Few of the benefits of cloud gaming include
                        freedom from gaming consoles and the need to invest in expensive and complicated hardware and
                        software; any-device gaming i.e. desktop PC, tablet, smartphone, laptop; ability to support
                        multiscreen gaming for a super widescreen gaming experience and full field-of-vision;
                        click-to-play simplicity; and anytime access to a wide library of game titles stored on the
                        cloud server. Cloud gaming also make obsolete digital downloads where games need to be
                        downloaded, and installed to be played. The gaming model also eliminates the need for frequent
                        game patches. </li>
                      <li><strong>Blockchain - </strong> The technology is anticipated to result in novel games, asset
                        classes, and application areas. Blockchain is offering novel opportunities for those that seek
                        to design gaming apps that are decentralized. The use of blockchain in gaming apps is
                        anticipated to be the main factor driving the world gaming market. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs are
                        used to buy in-game assets, which can be used to obtain real-life money. Cryptocurrency such as
                        Ethereum and Bitcoin facilitate quick and safe payments for different in-game purchases. Also,
                        it enables players to obtain Crypto tokens or rewards during gaming. Blockchain works to offer
                        freedom and decentralization and this enable gamers to actually exploit the capabilities of
                        games. The technology facilitates in bringing together communities and is likely to offer a more
                        immersive experience. In blockchain gaming, the transactions are similar to requiring an
                        entrance fee from other players to gain access to the environment created by the user. The fee
                        can be converted into actual currency via a cryptocurrency. Also, the other players playing the
                        game can obtain cryptocurrency for finishing the challenges created by the user. In this, the
                        players would own the game. Besides its role as a payment mechanism to enable game purchases,
                        blockchain has potential role in the creation and management of in-game currency accounts.
                        Players can be rewarded with gems, coins and other collectibles after winning certain rounds or
                        chalenges, with blockchain becoming the basis for managing the functioning of this process.
                      </li>>
                      <li><strong>Metaverse - </strong> The metaverse experience is as closely immersive as the real
                        world and has immense opportunities in the video games industry. Metaverse is taking shape with
                        immersive gaming worlds taking a lead on how users experience the virtual reality using their
                        virtual identities and how they socially interact, tour, engage in pleasure activities and
                        conduct business within the digital world using either real or cryptocurrency. Roblox, an online
                        gaming company, flaunts immersive virtual reality landscapes, growing repertoire of user
                        developed games and virtual spaces that have successfully hosted and monetized live concerts
                        using independent digital currency. Roblox capitalized on the draw of metaverse and its own
                        strength of user base by hosting exclusive product launches from luxury fashion brands,
                        co-creation of games and enticing gamers to access these products in exchange for the digital
                        currency. The company bought Guilded that engages in integrating online gaming platforms.
                        Architecture software design firm Autodesk is exploring its 3D design capabilities to create
                        virtual prototypes for AR and VR applications of metaverse.</li>
                      <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence - </strong> In video games, artificial intelligence is
                        primarily used in ascertaining the behavior of non-player characters (NPCs) in the games.
                        Traditionally, NPCs behave as per pre-programmed rules, and are therefore predictable for
                        experienced gamers. AI could make these characters behave more intelligently by the use of
                        Finite State Machine (FSM), which is an algorithm that was introduced in video gaming in the
                        1990s via games such as Half-Life, Dragon Quest IV, and Warcraft. An FSM predicts every possible
                        situation that the AI program of the game could encounter and accordingly generates a suitable
                        reaction for each possible occurrence. There are advanced FSMs that use machine learning to
                        enable NPCs to adapt to the gaming behavior of players, thus making them more challenging and
                        more unpredictable. AI in game development is mainly used for defining the manner in which the
                        behavior of the computer opponent. AI game programming mainly makes use of techniques such as
                        pathfinding and decision trees. Another way by which artificial intelligence is transforming
                        video games is through enhancement of graphics quality. AI could be used by animators to analyze
                        the way machines, animals, and human beings move in real life situations. By scanning and
                        analyzing number of hours of real-life footage, game designers could develop characters with
                        more realistic movements, displaying authentic facial expressions to deliver gaming experiences
                        that are more emotionally immersive.</li>

                    <p class=" m-0">Interesting after being one of the few industries to actually benefit from the
                      pandemic and post robust growth, the video games market is currently snapping under the pressure
                      of rising inflation, reduced consumer disposable incomes, supply chain disruptions, and chip
                      shortages that are impacting production of gaming hardware such as consoles and delaying scheduled
                      launches. Continuous delays in new game titles are also impacting consumer interest and
                      willingness to engage in games in the year 2022. The worsening economic fundamentals and the
                      dreaded fall in consumer confidence and sentiment is impacting spending on new video games and is
                      resulting in shrinking revenues for the market for the year. This slump in video games sales in
                      2022 comes in stark contrast to the once hailed “recession-proof” sector. However, the outlook for
                      2023 is expected to improve since video games will continue to keep levelling up with graphics
                      becoming more realistic and fantastical by the year and gameplay richer, smoother and storylines
                      adroitly designed pull at consumer heartstrings. Also improving economic climate in the year 2023
                      will help put growth back on track. The market in the medium term will continue to benefit from
                      rapid developments in hardware and software gaming platforms and revival of investments in the
                      development of new game genre, ideas and titles. Few of the factors that will drive improved
                      player engagement and thereby the increase in the number of active gamers worldwide will include
                      launch of virtual reality headsets and smartglasses that lend visual realism to games; development
                      of graphic-intensive games with more engaging and digitally immersive gameplays; rise of social
                      games with viral connections for more continuous engagement; launch of games with no pre-defined
                      ends, with ample in-game rewards and continuous offline evolution of game characters designed for
                      addictive play style; “Always On” sensors in electronic wearables, the ensuing rise of video game
                      enablement on wearables and design of micro-engagement models targeted at grabbing player
                      attention for just few seconds for an extreme user engagement.</p>

                      <li><strong>Immersive Experiences Will Impact Sales Scenarios - </strong> Following immense
                        popularity within the gamer community, the gaming space is touching new dimensions with
                        immersive and engaging experience at its core. The swift transition of gaming towards 3D
                        environments for immersive experience is benefiting visualization and 3D rendering software.
                        Powered by virtual reality, 3D graphics and appealing visualization, immersive is the future and
                        bound to revolutionize the gaming domain. Immersion is emerging as an indispensable and
                        necessary component of gaming, and witnessing incredible popularity among both game developers
                        and gamers. The increasing significance of immersion is reflected by growing popularity of
                        role-playing games. Video games have posted a notable evolution from simple pixels towards
                        sophisticated graphics over the last decades. The evolution has paved way for interesting
                        elements, including detailed immersion depicted by first-person action games and other options.
                        The increasing attention of detailed immersion in the field of video games has led to
                        significant expansion of genres, with role-playing games enjoying tremendous popularity among
                        gamers </li>
                      <li><strong>Social Gaming Will be the New Profit Flavour: </strong> Games are increasingly
                        becoming a social affair with a large percentage of gamers playing with either family or
                        friends. Among the social gamers in the United States, 17% play games with parents, 31% play
                        with other family members, 40% play with friends, and 12% play with their spouses. Few of the
                        reasons cited for playing with others include fun, socializing, connecting with friends and
                        peers, and building relationships. Over 65% of parents play game with their children only to
                        monitor game content. Given that games provide a platform for intergenerational play and
                        learning, there is a growing trend of grandparents playing video games with their grandchildren.
                        Building of communities around games bodes well for the growth of social gaming. Defined as a
                        type of online multi-player games played on social media platforms, social gaming is a raging
                        success worldwide. The social gaming wave was formed by a perfect storm of three converging
                        forces which include mobile technology, cloud computing, and social networking. Few of the major
                        technology trends playing key roles in the evolution of social gaming include emergence of cloud
                        computing technology, rise of social networking platforms and services, and launch of high-speed
                        mobile internet technologies such as 4G and 5G mobile networks.</li>
                      <li><strong>Women Emerge as the Largest Gaming Audience - </strong> Male dominance in Internet
                        usage is rapidly changing with females using social networking sites more often and spending
                        more time on these platforms. Women are top consumers of social media news, with over 60% of
                        women getting their news from these platforms. All of the leading social media platforms
                        including Facebook have over 10% higher women users. On Pinterest, the gender different is even
                        higher at over 30%. Women have also been found to use social media networks in more ways than
                        men right from sharing photos, news to engaging in product reviews and brand interaction. Women
                        have a greater tendency to support, access offers, and comment on brands via social media. For
                        instance, 56% of online women in the U.S. support brands on social media as against 43% for men.
                        35% of women use social media multiple times a day as against 24% for men. Over 50% and 35% of
                        women access social media through their smartphones and tablets respectively. In comparison,
                        only 40% and 18% of men access social media via smartphones and tablets respectively. The
                        changing scenario can be also be seen in the world gaming industry, where currently over 52% of
                        the gaming audience are made up of women. Most of the recent growth in the gaming industry has
                        been driven by the female consumer base.</li>
                      <li><strong>Wearables to Enter the Scene to Redefine Experiences - </strong> Among the latest
                        technology trends is the use of smartwatches for placing bets, a service being offered to meet
                        the convenience needs of gamblers. Smartwatches, though a new phenomenon, have gained immense
                        popularity in the recent past. Players are moving away from placing bets from their tablets or
                        mobile phones to placing bets from their smartwatches. Besides placing bets, smartwatches

                        effect, smartwatches are replacement of consumer devices such as mobile phones and tablets.
                        However, the casino industry is adapting to changing patterns and adapting to consumer
                        requirements. Smartwatches are not just a convenient option but an easily accessible choice for
                        online casinos. With wearable technology growing in popularity and the sales of smartwatches on
                        the rise, the gambling world is also poised to benefit from the power of wearable technology.
                        The development of new gaming software designed for integration into various devices including
                        smartwatches will be provide further impetus to the smartwatch casinos. Smartwatch casinos
                        represent the latest form of interactive online gambling systems that come integrated with the
                        features of traditional land based casinos. </li>
