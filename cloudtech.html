                    is a critical ingredient of the digital transformation journey as it allows organizations to lift
                    the customer experience, boost employee productivity and expedite the evolution. Companies with
                    obsolete IT infrastructure lack tools and processes to meet customer expectations. The rapidly
                    changing landscape requires businesses to deliver an omnichannel experience that can be adapted in
                    real-time. The move needs cloud-based, integrated business applications to help employees access
                    updated insights pertaining to consumer requirements. In addition, traditional approaches and
                    systems affect employee productivity as they lack desired flexibility and agility to adapt to new
                    functions, to scale and to fulfill evolving demands. Legacy systems fail to ensure collaboration
                    among team members and are vulnerable to downtime.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p class=" m-0">Multiple industries have in the past few years been transformed, in various ways, by
                    the cloud and the global automotive industry is no exception. Cloud-based solutions for the
                    automotive industry is rapidly increasing in number and variety that the market is currently worth a
                    whopping US$65 billion worldwide. Cloud is critical for connected cars, shared mobility, autonomous
                    driving, digital manufacturing, customer insights and many other aspects of the modern automotive
                    industry that is fast evolving to serve customers for the digital era. Cloud-based solutions make
                    operations of the automotive companies faster, better and also safer. The solutions help enhance
                    customer experience through in-vehicle entertainment. They also reduce risk of data loss. Autonomous
                    vehicles are the self-driving vehicles that need least manual intervention. These sense the live
                    environment with the help of AI algorithms. ADAS leveraging sensor data and real-time HD maps are
                    able to make riding pleasant and safer for passengers. However, the system is complex and needs
                    continuous and rigorous testing and validation, in complex environments and on roads. Cloud-based
                    simulators are used for the purpose as these feature higher computational abilities required for
                    transferring huge data volumes. </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Cloud based solutions also enable shared mobility which is the ride-sharing concept
                    that is fast gaining prominence. It is a transportation mode in which vehicles are shared on the
                    basis of needs, among users, and this helps reduce traffic issues and carbon emissions. Cloud-based
                    applications for shared mobility can integrate a Google Map or any other map for providing live
                    traffic updates and alternative routes with less traffic. They would also provide the estimated time
                    that would be taken for reaching destination. Algorithms can also notify cab drivers to nearest
                    customers which would reduce idle time for drivers and wait time for customers.
                    Cloud technology also offers auto makers specialized tools and services for big data analytics,
                    enabling them to gather best insights about customers. Query Engine for instance, can digest data,
                    store it and also analyse and present it as interactive charts, graphs and dashboards. Auto makers
                    would be able to better understand trends for improving supply chain, manufacturing, marketing and
                    also enhance customer experience.
                  </p>


                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Cloud-based solutions also enable digital manufacturing for auto makers. Intelligent
                    algorithms developed based on cloud data can aid manufacturers in predictive maintenance, safety,
                    data analytics and reporting, and also real-time monitoring of various production processes. This
                    would reduce the amount of errors in production. Costs of setting up IT infrastructure and
                    monitoring it would also be eliminated for auto makers when they choose cloud service providers for
                    the job. Cloud service providers enable the companies to effectively monitor their IT infrastructure
                    and keep it up and running at all times</p>

                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">Cloud based solutions for the automotive industry also reduces complexity of operations
                    to a great extent. The high computing capabilities offered by cloud service providers enable auto
                    makers to perform complicated and large engineering simulations and tasks and also data analytics,
                    easily. Cloud solutions provide automatic scalability for servers, on-demand data storage, and
                    enhanced computing capabilities and thus reduce complexity. Cloud solutions also offer enhanced
                    security for data and provide backup. Whether data from smart vehicles, manufacturing, customer
                    sales & services, supply chain or marketing, all of it is constantly backed up. This ensures that
                    critical data is not lost in accident wipe-outs or sudden system failures.</p>

                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">Another industry to witness the revolutionizing impact of cloud technology is the
                    semiconductor and electronic design automation (EDA) industry. One of the most common cloud services
                    used in the semiconductor industry is Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), through which EDA companies
                    deliver their customers the ability of developing and running their PDKs over the cloud. The use of
                    PaaS for running EDA software on certain designs enable companies in avoiding the high capital
                    investment involved in procuring servers for providing the required processing runtime and power,
                    along with the recurrent cost associated with supporting and maintaining those resources. The high
                    level of computing demanded by modern integrated circuit (IC) designs can prove challenging for
                    several companies to be able to procure, install, and maintain the desired amount of computing
                    resources required for maintaining high-speed verification runtimes and at the same ensuring that
                    the design quality is not compromised. </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">Design companies can significantly benefit from cloud computing as it can offer them an
                    opportunity for accelerating their time to market and speeding up innovation. These can be achieved
                    through accelerating the process of design verification. Through avoiding the high cost involved in
                    the acquisition and maintenance of hardware and removal of latency barriers associated with resource
                    usage, cloud computing can allow EDA companies in gaining instant accessibility to computing
                    resources they require, while concurrently leveraging the inherent scaling capabilities of the
                    platform, thereby enabling them in efficiently achieving their physical verification targets, such
                    as overnight runtimes. Moving EDA technology into the cloud can also offer a fast and cost-effective
                    mechanism for handling late-breaking emergencies. In case all internal resources of a company are
                    committed and a critical issue arises that requires immediate resolution, cloud computing offers the
                    mechanism of resolving the issue without causing any major disruptions in other activities. </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">There are various different ways through which EDA companies can further improve the
                    cost-effectiveness of their cloud deployments. These include using the most recent foundry-qualified
                    rule deck for ensuring the adoption of most updated coding best practices. In addition, companies
                    can implement hierarchical filing methodology, which allows sorting of a design into cells that can
                    be subsequently referred to in the top design levels, thereby significantly reducing data size as
                    well as enabling a substantial reduction in final sign-off runtimes. Operations that need multiple
                    resources often take up all those resources even prior to the execution, resulting in most resources
                    often remaining idle for long time periods. Through implementation of technology and processes that
                    enable connection to resources only at the time when they are required can facilitate users in
                    minimizing their cloud computing costs by eliminating or reducing idle resources. Moreover,
                    selection of geographically-close cloud servers can help EDA companies in reducing their network
                    latency time.</p>

                  <br />

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Content Management Will Move to the Cloud -</strong> Cloud-based enterprise content management (ECM) is poised to gather considerable momentum over the coming years as a result of the growing need to govern and manage burgeoning content volumes. While the content generated globally is doubling every three months, around 80% of the content intended to be leveraged by knowledge workers for revenue-generation business goals remains unstructured. The staggering growth of the unstructured data is providing a major impetus to the cloud-based ECM. Cloud-based ECM enables companies to efficiently manage the content without the need to invest in associated infrastructure. The solution also enables efficient document management and makes documents centralized for quick search. The software links all documents to appropriate accounts to ensure seamless search. The software enables authorized people to access the content and data from anywhere using different devices.

ECM protects and secures documents to help businesses in controlling access to the information on the basis of user profiles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Orchestration -</strong> Automation and cloud orchestration are technologies that are intended to automate repetitive processes. However, the two are not the same. Automation is a subgroup of cloud orchestration, implying that orchestration coordinates various automated activities. Automation can be referred to as enabling repetition of a task without operator intervention or with minimum involvement. Considering that the cloud platform involves numerous moving parts, orchestration is designed to minimize staff endeavors by combining and streamlining the various tasks as a single process. The tasks include scaling, dependency management and failure recovery in addition to various other tasks. A single process can be effectively automated using automation tools while cloud orchestration facilitates the flow of automated processes. A workflow can be created encompassing numerous automated processes beginning with the initial request all the way to completion using cloud orchestration tools. The workflow basically automates the entire process of service delivery. Complex processes, involving various resources, across numerous cloud domains can be coordinated using cloud orchestration tools, which ensure overall process control in order to meet client needs. Cloud Orchestration also prevents security breaches d. Compliance testing, configuration validation and regular vulnerability scans are simplified though the use of cloud orchestration. Errors that stem during configuration set-up can be avoided owing to the implementation of standardized configuration and the ability to re-use the same for other processes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Security - </strong>Integration of this critical IAM infrastructure of organizations, onto the cloud architecture, is gaining traction. Cloud IAM solutions provide detailed access control as well visibility, which enable organizations to centrally manage their cloud resources and provide secure access to the resources, for users. Access control can be more efficiently managed with cloud IAM as it defines who has what kind of access for specific resources. Cloud-hosted IAM can be private, public or a combination of both. For companies from varied end-user industries, cloud IAM offers critical benefits including synchronization as well as provisioning of identities, federation service, single sign-on features and customer identity management among others. Enterprises are able to reduce the complexity and costs involved in managing compliance and access control, by adopting cloud for IAM. Another security technology gaining prominence is cloud security gateways/broker include a combination of multiple types of security solutions such as, single sign on, encryption, tokenization, logging, API control, key management, fine-grained access controls, advanced security intelligence data for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), among others. Cloud security gateways (CSGs), also called as CASBs, act as a gatekeeper for organizations accessing cloud resources, allowing them to extend the reach of security policies beyond their on-premise infrastructure.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Future is Hybrid –</strong> Hybrid clouds bridge the gap between internal private and external public clouds and enable an organization to get maximum value from their IT through priority based dispersal of workload. For instance, hybrid clouds help organizations leverage the power of private clouds for managing mission critical workloads such as BI analytics, financial analysis and forecasting, while transferring non-critical workloads such as HR & IT processes to the public cloud. While external facing applications are usually used on a public cloud, internal applications are used on a private cloud. By helping them limit use of expensive but secure private clouds only for critical applications and leverage inexpensive public cloud for non-critical applications, the hybrid cloud model allows organizations to reduce their total cost of their cloud deployments and at the same time be assured of security and scalability to their key applications and data. Hybrid cloud is also a cost-effective solution for managing temporary increases in computing needs as it provides the much required scalability and flexibility in handling them without the need for deploying additional physical infrastructure. Given the benefits of hybrid cloud in balancing priority based workloads and reducing the need for expensive private cloud infrastructure, hybrid cloud deployment model is now emerging as the future of cloud computing and a necessity for companies to operate in the 21st century.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Exchanges Emerge as the New generation of Cloud Brokers –</strong> Cloud exchanges are presently in their early stages of evolution. This business model set into motion by the cloud commoditization trend will interestingly push the trend further in the coming years.
