                <div class="card-body p-5">
                  <p class=" m-0">The global banking industry is currently undergoing a huge digital disruption, with mobile apps, e-bill payments and online deposits among others becoming commonplace. AI and such other sophisticated technologies have been at the centre of banking digital transformation for some time now. AI automates back-end operations of a bank, including its data processing and administrative tasks. There are also digital-only banks, that evolved recently, and these operate entirely electronically. Called Neobanks, these banks do not depend on a physical location. They are instead powered through digital platforms, which are more appealing to Gen Z and millennial clients. In several countries, especially the developed economies, these neobanks have been accelerating digital transformation of their banking sectors.</p>
                    <br/>
                  <p class=" m-0">Cash is increasingly becoming obsolete as IT makes a revolutionizing entry into the retail banking sector. Personal cheques and hard currency are becoming less popular, while increasing investments in FinTech solutions have pushed up innovations such as PayPal, Square, Apple Pay and cryptocurrencies, thereby boosting the cashless age. Contactless card payments have made even smaller value transactions/payments faster and easier. Other major factors driving the world towards a cashless society include launch of chip and pin payment cards, broadening ecosystem of smartphone payments apps, convergence of finance, banking and telecommunications, and rapid changes in custom, culture and regulations elicited by Internet technologies, strong penetration of Internet enabled smartphones etc. Strong venture capital funding of financial technology start-ups and their commercial innovations are disrupting the status quo held by cash. Stringent regulations and policies and sops such as reduction in value-added tax (VAT) rates on card payments are additionally encouraging the evolution of cashless societies. </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Several countries are already witnessing the gradual death of cash such as Netherlands where cash is no longer accepted, while few others are strategically executing economic and financial policies aimed at deliberately reducing the amount of physical cash circulating in the economy such as India, Nigeria (Cash-less Nigeria Project), among others. A key reason for the regulatory clampdown on cash in developing countries is the growing burden of cash usage such as costs associated for handling the cash i.e. paper currency printing, deployment/maintenance of ATMs, high risk of money laundering, higher ability to manipulate cash transactions for tax avoidance, breeding of large unorganized sectors that create “shadow economies” that make no contribution to a economy’s GDP growth, inability of the government to impose fiscal controls, reduced productivity of the banking sector in terms of foregone interest, reduced corporate dividends, high counterfeiting costs, among others. </p>


                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">The scenario has provided the foundation for the rise of various digital banking solutions such as Payment Tools, Processing Services, Customer & Channel Management platforms, and Risk Management solutions. Of various categories, sustained demand for Payment Tools and Processing Services, which currently account for a collective share of over 60% of total market revenues, has elevated the market prospects in a major way. Growth momentum in the digital banking market is poised to remain strongly upward through the current decade in tandem with ongoing digitization trends in the banking & financial services sector. Factors such as integration of advanced technologies into the banking system, massive expansion in internet penetration and smartphone adoption, fast evolving relevance of online and mobile banking platforms, and soaring need to improve customer experience strategies are expected to provide fertile environment for market expansion. Supportive government initiatives and policies and emergence of new and innovative technologies on an ongoing basis constitute other major drivers for the market. </p>
                  <br/>
                  <p class="m-0">A growing number of banking & financial service firms are moving towards digital platforms to offer their services acknowledging the high penetration rate of internet and Internet-connected devices such as smartphones. The rapidly increasing speed, bandwidth, storage capacity and on-demand computing capabilities offered by the Internet is fueling banking entities to shift towards online business models, emphasizing transactions and payments through debit and credit cards and third party providers such as PayPal. With mobile Internet services providing access to various online portals and banking apps on-the-go, customers are now able to access online banking portals and make instantaneous transactions through online banking and debit/credit card credentials. At the same time, intense pressure on banking firms to minimize operating costs in order to stay competitive is also having a major bearing on uptake of digital banking solutions.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p class="m-0">Digital banking continues to gain traction among banking firms by enabling them to keep systems up-to-date, offer modified services at minimal costs and an improved customer experience. Banking entities are also leaning towards digital solutions amid rapidly rising demand for non-transactional services due to the ease of operation and cost-effectiveness of such services. On the other hand, increased willingness among consumers, especially the younger demographics who are choice conscious, hyper connected, and has digital knowledge to take up the digital technology enabled services is encouraging banking firms to adopt digital solutions. Banking as a Service (BaaS) and Banking as a Platform (BaaP), which collectively account for an estimated 34% share of total digital banking revenues, has emerged as the top-of-class platforms for banking entities. BaaS and BaaP platforms are poised to make strong gains over the analysis period, thereby driving overall momentum in the digital banking market. BaaS strives to address the need to adjust the essence of the banking operation from maintaining a pricing policy based on liabilities and assets to brokering and providing attractive value-added services for customers on an ongoing basis. </p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Digital-First Becomes a Priority:</strong> With customers worldwide demanding more personalized digital banking experiences, banks and FIs are racing towards becoming digital-first organizations. The global banking industry is transforming into an experience oriented industry from being a product-centered one. Customer experience is now a major differentiator for banks and FIs as they constantly strive to retain existing customers and acquire new ones. More hyper-personalized banking services and products are being offered, helped by AI, ML and data analytics among other technologies with the anticipation that higher level personalization can create stronger loyalty.  However, not all banks and FIs have been able to leverage hyper-personalization to the fullest as they lack data as well as the analytic capabilities needed for driving such strategies. Banks therefore are required to first build the critical data analytics infrastructure for success of their digital marketing strategies. 
                    The digital transformation in conventional financial services providers prompted the emergence of many new players offering solutions like peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms, digital wealth management tools, and robo-advisors. Such initiatives have gained momentum owing to open banking APIs. Fintech companies have pioneered digital innovation across many areas like payments, money transfers, and lending. Many such startups are now competing with banks in a big way as they widen their customer bases and services. Banks have already joined hands with various fintech firms to fast-track their digital transformation efforts and match steps with startups that are causing a major disruption in the banking industry.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom:20px"><strong>Rise of Open Banking:</strong> Another prominent digital banking trend had been the rise of open banking that enables banks share data and information with other banks and FIs for better serving client needs. Such sharing enables better recommendation to financial management and a faster and customized service. APIs or application programming interfaces that are used for open banking, have already been employed by several pioneering banks globally. Most of them were able to report impressive success stories especially in cross-selling products and services. Furthermore, the huge loads of data that would be accumulated from APIs’ usage and the open banking system would bring forth innovations faster. 

                      <br/>
                      <br/>
                      Even though open API banking continues to be in its nascent stages, it has the potential to revolutionize digital banking. Open APIs enable financial institutions to share financial data with various third-party providers or fintechs. Such apps are making digital transactions quicker, simpler, and more secure across digital platforms. Some preeminent banks in Europe and the US have embraced open banking APIs and reported incredible results. Since the line between banking and various financial services providers keeps blurring, APIs will emerge as an efficient solution for financial institutions to create more potential in cross-selling transactions or products. Open banking APIs are anticipated to allow the sharing of data between customers, financial institutions, and third-party service providers. The ensuing integration could lead to rapid innovation and superior consumer experiences for banks as well as their clients. Still, open APIs face a significant challenge in terms of security since financial institutions have to make sure that consumer data is well protected without decelerating the API workflow, for instance, introducing manual verification can be time-consuming in the API process and may demand extra security measures to avoid hacking. Third-party providers and banks are expected to favor open banking APIs even in 2023. On the other hand, developers may prioritize hybrid or closed APIs to protect their data from falling into the hands of external parties. Developers and financial institutions are likely to collaborate more closely to integrate their technologies in the best way possible.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Use of AI Chatbots:</strong> Banks are also increasingly using AI-based chatbots for not just providing round-the-clock support to customers but also for gathering information pertaining to their preferences to provide them with more personalized services. AI-based chatbots, mobile apps, call centres and ATMs allow banks to quickly understand customer requirements and identify data-backed solutions for the problem at hand. Banks worldwide have also started using AI for solving issues in the areas of fraud detection, risk management, and cybersecurity in addition to customer service. AI is also projected to decrease operation costs of banks by about 25%, by 2030, which would mean savings that would amount to trillions of dollars. 
                    <br/><br/>Natural language processing technology will become standard practice for consumer interaction in 2023. The emergence of virtual assistants and chatbots is already big across various sectors, but it is their adaptability that offers tremendous value in the banking industry. Banks must leverage this technology to offer an outstanding experience to their consumers. They can offer automated answers to consumer FAQs, lower the volume of calls to the call center, and free up employee time for tasks that are more important. By 2023, such technologies will be the rule rather than the exception in banking apps in many devices, including tablets and smartphones. Currently, nearly 10 banks have introduced their chatbots. The uptake of banking chatbots has been quite high among Chinese banks for day-to-day transactions. India’s HDFC Bank introduced a virtual assistant on its online banking platform to stay in tune with consumer preferences and expectations. This pilot was part of its effort to improve digital customer experience. Spanish bank BBVA launched a virtual assistant which has gained widespread popularity among youngsters in the Latin American region.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Service Offerings - </strong> Customer-centricity is becoming bigger in the banking sector as consumers seek experiences that are more personalized and do more tasks themselves. With advances in digital transformation, various self-service offerings such as mobile account opening can be accessed at the closest ATM or bank branch, allowing customers to easily and swiftly open accounts without needing to go to the bank branch. The advent of online banking is transforming the retail banking industry and elevating consumer experience with improved self-service capabilities, quicker account opening, broader transactional accessibility, and safer transactions. With greater consumer engagement, banks are able to create new streams of revenue by cross-selling financial products. Increasing the convenience of banking is at the core of digital transformation which seeks to help customers meet their goals effortlessly. Automated banking processes are likely to revolutionize service quality in 2023, with advanced analytics powering self-service tools to help customers make decisions that are better informed and faster.</li>
                    <li><strong>No-Code/Low-Code Development Platforms -</strong> Sluggish development projects are a big no-no. The banking sector is witnessing a faster time-to-market trend, with low-code/no-code development platforms allowing banks to efficiently and quickly create digital products. In 2023, there will be large-scale adoption of low-code and no-code development platforms in the banking sector for many reasons. Firstly, banks will have to fast-track the rolling out of digital services and products. Secondly, there will be significant growth in various third-party fintech firms providing pre-built solutions which allow easy integration into basic banking systems. Lastly, there will be a scarcity of specialized and skilled workers for application development.  </li>
                    <li><strong>Accommodative Digital Banking Ecosystem-</strong> Digital ecosystems of banks would also become more accommodative in the years ahead. With super apps emerging, banks and financial institutions would be required to continuously extend their digital ecosystems so as to accommodate new technologies. This is required for reducing friction for their customers. Integrated ecosystems would allow banks to unionize channels and processes for providing customers with a seamless banking experience. </li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Computing Usage Increases- </strong> Banks have also started to use cloud computing and this has been another major digital banking trends recently. Cost efficiency, increased productivity, high security, speed of operations, reliability, convenience and scalability at the global level are a few benefits with cloud computing for the banking sector. Cloud computing also allows the banking industry to eliminate the massive data silos. It alleviates the need for the large physical servers and technicians for managing those servers, thus saving considerable costs for banks. </li>
                    <li><strong>Blockchain to Play Vital Role- </strong> Blockchain would also come to play a key role in changing the digital banking landscape in the years ahead. Cryptocurrency payments, despite their volatile nature, are anticipated of leave their mark on the global financial landscape. Already several digital banks are offering crypto-compatible payment services. Banks are anticipated to invest considerably in blockchain innovations in the years ahead. By becoming crypto-compatible, flexible and agile, such digital banks would gain competitive advantages like no other.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rise of BaaS- </strong> Another major ongoing trend in the banking industries of many countries lately has been the rise of BaaS (Banking-as-a-Service). BaaS currently accounts for a significant portion of digital services of banks in several countries. There are already open banking and BaaS regulations in a few countries. The UK is an example and many countries would follow suit over the coming years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Persistent Security Threats- </strong> Digital banking products are more vulnerable to security issues. Banks therefore have been investing considerably in enhancing security. More secure digital banking protects customers from phishing and data theft among other issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Online CX -</strong> After the global COVID-19 pandemic, around 41 per cent of bank customers in the United States became digital-only compared to 30 per cent in 2020. This means that web platforms and apps are their one and only point-of-interaction with the business. Therefore, banks will be able to retain their customers only by ensuring that the online consumer experience remains hassle-free and pleasant. If not, they can get ready to say goodbye to their customers. Along with intuitive application design as well as functionality, today’s consumers seek friendly employees, 24/7 service, personalized experience, loyalty programs, and prompt response. Thankfully, good quality of online banking featuring automation capabilities usually takes care of most CX requirements. For instance, banks can elevate online banking by adding a chatbot to collect requests and offer support 24/7. This will also cater to the demand for personalized experience and prompt service. </li>
                    <li><strong>Buy-Now-Pay-Later Model -</strong> Consumers are increasingly willing to utilize the Buy-Now-Pay-Later or BNPL model. Apart from allowing customers to make payments for purchases later, this option also benefits businesses by improving both customer engagement and sales, particularly for online retailers. These obvious advantages will make BNPL a top consumer trend within the banking sector in 2023. An increasing number of websites are expected to offer this form of payment to consumers. The versatility and range of different fintech services offering solutions for seamless BNPL payments are also anticipated to grow. Affirm, Uplift, Klarna, and Afterpay already support BNPL transactions. </li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Wallets –</strong> Digital wallet usage continues to grow, a change from the days of having to carry multiple credit cards in wallets. It is also challenging for businesses to cater to consumer demand for brand-new payment methods in order to remain competitive. Consumers currently have a preference for digital wallets from banks. However, the trend of digital wallets from retailers, tech startups, or smartphone manufacturers is also gaining momentum. Hence, developing a customized digital wallet is a good idea for larger retail platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Omnichannel Engagement -</strong> Even though the shift to digital banking is taking place at a rapid pace, 50 per cent of consumers would like to retain their bank branch services. Therefore, embracing the fully digital model in 2023 is still too early for banks that are not neobanks and continue to operate physical branches. Omnichannel offers the best way forward in such cases as it allows banks to serve consumers through mobile apps, web platforms, as well as physical bank branches simultaneously. This will enable consumers to select the channel which is most convenient for them. However, omnichannel engagement demands that consumers receive all services irrespective of their chosen channel. It is important that digital banks power feature-rich mobile and web apps. Non-financial businesses should also ensure that all services like payments, among others, are accessible across all channels. </li>
                    <li><strong>Big Data and Analytics -</strong> Since data plays a critical role in understanding consumers and customizing services, companies are always building systems that feature advanced analytics. Leading fintech players depend on big data processing in order to create in-depth customer profiles, provide tailored loans, make informed decisions about lending, and analyze spending patterns, among others. Embracing such consumer trends within the digital banking industry significantly saves time on every consumer request. It also guarantees more personalized services to customers along with robust customer-centricity. Big data allows banks to make consumer behavior central to their business. By optimizing predictive analytics, businesses can increase sales and offer more customized services. In the years ahead, a bank’s ability to learn from clients will be fundamental to achieving effective digital transformation. Analytics will be critical in customer acquisition strategies, cross-selling, and market segmentation. Consequently, banks will gain deeper insights into consumer spending patterns and behavior, which can assist them in creating targeted services and products. In 2023, intuitive and fast data collection is likely to power more closed-loop solutions. This will enable banks to get a 360-degree view of their client’s needs, offering them contextually relevant data about personalized offers or discounts.  </li>
                    <li><strong>Widening Scope of Banking Apps -</strong> Instead of serving as only self-service tools, banking apps will emerge as customer relationship management platforms in 2023 that predict consumer needs and offer personalized advice on the basis of their finances. Banking apps will serve as smart digital assistants which can anticipate consumer preferences and needs on the basis of their financial habits or patterns. For instance, if a consumer transfers money to their savings account regularly on payday every month but forgets to add funds to their payment card in the month to come, this smart app will effectively predict that the client will require money for their card soon. The smart assistant proactively communicates with the client and makes recommendations and suggestions before the client can think of the issue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Embedded Finance - </strong>Consumer trends in the banking industry impact other industries as well, particularly those that cater to consumers and have significantly large volumes of transactions every day. One such trend is embedded finance which refers to the integration of financial features into non-fintech products. Retailers, healthcare providers, and e-commerce stores, among others, embed banking, lending, payment, and insurance functionality into products. This enables users to receive financial services without exiting a non-fintech platform. Since these consumer trends are gaining prominence in the digital banking industry, there will soon be more apps that have embedded fintech tools. Plaid, Stripe, jaris, and Resolve are some solutions that allow embedded payments.</li>
